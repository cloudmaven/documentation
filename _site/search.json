Epigenome = all of the machinery associated with the genome: Protein manufacture, gene regulation, etc      Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization    A prior study used for comparatives is called CHROMIMPUTE.          The paper for this was published by Ernst and Kellis in 2015 in Nature Biotechnology.        The researcher for this study is Tim Durham, a graduate student in Bill Noble’s genomics lab at the University of Washington.          The results improve over the CHROMIMPUTE study for global mean squared error.      CHROMIMPUTE does better by comparison on the other metrics; but the methods are still close.      The computation is a form of machine learning (modeling) and is built on the Apache Spark engine      The data volume is a three-dimensional tensor with axes: Human cell types, human proteins, and the human genome                  The cell type axis is 120 or so cell types          The protein axis is similarly 150 or so proteins          The genome axis is three billion nucleotides                    The model is trained and one important result is that two of the model components can be locally optimized using only 1% of the genome      The entire genome would take some time… 24-48 hours depending on the cluster size      Today 1% of the genome requires five hours on 64 cores: That is an X1.16xlarge                  More memory than needed; but still cheap per core          optimized data structures to use compressed-format matrices          cell type and assay matrix training used 1% of 1% of the data; so that all fit on one machine          500GB required; 1.4TB available                    Next steps  Write the paper  publish the software and tutorial on GitHub and cloudmaven will point to this          Add some interpretability to the code      HDInsight or EMR on AWS: Is fine.      Tim ran Spark EC2 which bootstraps an EC2 cluster… but you need to be root                  Spark EC2 is from AmpLab on GitHub.com/amplab/spark-ec2          AWS makes it hard for you to log in as root…                    EMR now permits some spot market access (although the X1.16xlarge may or may not be part of that)        Entire genome          Publish the results “whole genome imputed tracks through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ‘ENCODE’                  Hopefully by start of summer          There are three obstacles in the way of imputing the whole genome right now.                          The first (and much bigger) issue is that this will take more time and money than I currently have              It’s proving harder than I thought it would to get Spark to swallow the full data set, so I will have to do some additional software engineering to process the full genome in batches.              The third reason that we have de-prioritized training on the whole genome is that we’ve found that the model performs essentially as well on 0.01% of the data as it does on 1% of the data, so we don’t expect to get much of a performance boost by training on everything.                                            Tim will turn next to some wet lab work: Studying tissue development in a nematode C.elegansSpeed up for cloud implementation  From weeks to order of hours          ChromImpute led to training the model on 127 cell types and 24 assays for comparison purposes        This imputes hypothetical results in silico in place of wet lab experiments.Computation and cost details  How much does one such physical wet lab experiment cost (i.e. one cell type, one protein assay, 3 billion base pairs)?A typical run that I’m doing now takes about 8 hrs with 1 x m4.xlarge instance (4 cores, 16 GB memory) and 1 x x1.16xlarge instance (64 cores, 976 GB memory). The head node (m4.xlarge) is a normal EC2 instance, while the worker (x1.16xlarge) is a spot instance, so the price isn’t consistent, but it stays at around $1.22/hr. So a single training run costs ~$10; we tend to do a cross-validation scheme with 4-8 folds, so the total cost of processing a model runs about $80 and takes two to three days. Data storage is the other big component of the cost. With the subset of the experiments and genomic positions that I am working with the output of one of these cross-validation runs is about 750 GB stored on S3. Loading the entire genome into memory for all training examples takes about 1.5 TB, so training on the whole genome will produce at least 4.5 TB considering that the 1.5 TB does not include 2/3 of the data. My total S3 usage right now is significantly higher even than that because I have been keeping results from all the preliminary experiments I’ve done over the past year trying to tune the model, but I’ll clean those up soon once the paper comes together.Anyway, storage costs for a single imputation run (as I’m currently running it) are on the order of $20/month, so I guess the total imputation cost is about $100. This compares pretty favorably to the cost of collecting the data in the lab – a quick search for services that will perform these assays show prices as high as $1000/sample, but I’m not sure how much it would cost a lab equipped to do the assay in-house.Model training at the 1% scale takes ten to 24 hours wall clock time.You could make the run time pretty reasonable but the whole genome has proven problematic for otherreasons; see above.Tim details on cost  $300 EMR with no spot instances  $88 EMR with spot  $1.25 for X1.16xlarge when Tim last checked but this instance may not work  … so we go to another (allowed) 2 x R3.8xlarge instance and that gives us the above costs          (EMR does not permit R4 as far as we know at the moment)        1% of the genome, requiring 48 hours  100% of genome scales linearly and this (with a bit of coding) should scale sideways          so the entire genome would require some testing: Spin up 100 3-node clusters? Bigger dataset?        Without EMR: $90 becomes $60          large instances are $.27 / hour / instance      Full genome  Pending  Train cell type and assay parameters (the smaller dimensions) on a small subset of genomic positions          Then apply those across the genome in batches        …to publish imputed results plus code plus tutorial for use by others  Of 127 cell types x 24 assays there are 1014 (33%) experimental datasets  The full project with additional cell types and protein assays has only 2% of the possible data"

Sun Grid Engine (SGE): The Scheduler we use in coordination with cfncluster in this case study.  Configuration Instance: A small AWS EC2 instance (T2) used to set up and run the cfncluster.  Master: An AWS EC2 instance with necessary EBS volume attached running as the Master node of a cfncluster under SGE.  Worker: An AWS EC2 Spot market instance of some type (e.g. c3.8xlarge is the powerful option) that is executing tasks on virtual CPUs / threads.  Rosetta AMI: The machine image used to spin up one Master and many Worker nodes  Task: One run of Rosetta requiring (typically) 8 minutes on a fairly powerful machine; compute intensive, reports back (a small data volume of) results to the Master node.  Small Test 1: 300 nodes running about 16 parallel tasks at 6 minutes each using a static random number seed, i.e. each task uses the same seed; identical calculations.  Small Test 2: Same as Small Test 1 but with unique random number seeds generated for each task. Tasks now require on average 8 minutes on c3.8xlarge and some may run much longer.  Big Test: Specifics to be determined; possibly several Small-Test-2 runs in parallel for example; must be scientifically useful; run time &lt;= 2 hours; larger number of EC2 Worker instances.

That is the case for now; and we will generalize to an arbitrary AWS User in the future. Here we go.When I hit Launch I have a conversation about choice of Key PairRather than use something existing I’m going to simply create and download a new key pair.Following the usual procedure to log in using PuTTY we quickly arrive atWe now proceed in the Linux operating system on this cfncluster control instance. It will be used to create the execution environment on other EC2 instances, specifically instances running on the AWS Spot market.% sudo pip install cfnclusterThis creates (in my home directory) a directory called .cfncluster. I can verify that this installed by running% cfnclusterThe output confirms that the command is present (installed).Next we build a config file in the .cfncluster directory with the following contents:[aws]aws_region_name = us-west-2aws_access_key_id = ### REDACTED ###aws_secret_access_key =  ### REDACTED ###[global]update_check = truesanity_check = truecluster_template = rosetta_cfn_test[cluster rosetta_cfn_test]vpc_settings = publickey_name = my_IAM_User_keypair_filename_with_no_extensioncompute_instance_type = c4.8xlargemaster_instance_type = c4.8xlargeinitial_queue_size = 2max_queue_size = 300maintain_initial_size = falsescheduler = sgebase_os = ubuntu1604custom_ami = ami-11df6571master_root_volume_size = 30compute_root_volume_size = 30cluster_type = spotspot_price = 0.72scaling_settings = custom[vpc public]master_subnet_id = subnet-4a37992dcompute_subnet_id = subnet-4b37992cvpc_id = vpc-5c891c3b[scaling custom]scaling_cooldown = 20Notice that for ‘key_name’ you must enter the key pair file name associated with your IAM User identity without any extensions.Notice and check that max_queue_size is set to 300. (The original was a value of 2 which is not correct (but safe).) This is the maximum number of spot instances we will be spinning up in the subsequent processing.Notice that the access keys are redacted. These are IAM User credentials. You must supply these from an IAM User account (perhaps your own). This IAM User must have adequate permissions. kilroy these should be stated. kilroy whether blanket ‘admin’ is sufficient should be made clear.Look at the file job_submission.sh. There is a command argument -nstruct with a subsequentinteger value such as 1000. This file will not be put to use on this machine; but will be copied tothe Master machine shortly. Once there the nstruct parameter will have important implications for the Rosetta processing task; so we will revisit this before starting that task.(The nstruct number is a number of random seeds that the Rosetta job will create. Kilroy this needs further elaboration. We want to ensure that the nstruct value is large enough that the number of jobs we launch (number of instances x jobs per instance) does not exceed the number of random seeds we have available. Perhaps this number could be set to 1 million?Next we will use the cfncluster meta-command to ‘create’ a cfncluster: Three AWS instancesthat act as the starting point for the Rosetta processing run.$ cfncluster create rosetta-identifierNote that ‘rosetta-identifier’ can be any recognizable indentification string.We expect the create task to take a few minutes.What is cfncluster create doing?First it is going to create a trackable presence on the AWS console under Cloud Formation. Let’s take a look at that by finding Cloud Formation on the AWS Console.Here is the general outline of what is happening:The cfncluster create command is building three EC2 instances from one existing AMI with some additional configuration to follow. The first EC2 instance will be a Master instance and theother two are Worker instances. All three machines will be on standby once they start; they have no work to do yet.cfncluster builds all three instances according to the rules we set up in the config file; and the build will also include the job_submission.sh file that we noted above has an ‘nstruct’ parameter.cfncluster create will install Sun Grid Engine on the Master Server. It will run some other boilerplate scripts taken from S3 storage.  The Rosetta configuration files are pre-loaded on the AMI.  The Workers, while they are not doing any work yet, are ready to go as they have the Rosetta software and the Rosetta configuration files pre-installed.Starting RosettaAfter cfncluster create finishes we will log in to the Master and use the qsub command to submit the Rosetta job. This will in turn create a job queue: A long list of processing tasks (perhaps 100,000 of them). These jobs will be schedule one by one, that is: Assigned to the Worker nodes.Each Worker node will have some number of ‘virtual CPUs’ available for running Rosetta jobs in parallel. These are compute-intensive jobs and each may complete in a matter of a few minutes. The number of jobs is given as 100,000 as this (for our initial implementation) is due to a sufficient sample density in a Monte Carlo simulation.While we may run 100,000 jobs these may be distributed across perhaps only 300 Workers. These Workers will (for this example) be powerful machines, each with the capacity to run 36 jobs simultaneously. The jobs we expect to take about 8 minutes each; so in the course of an hour we expect about 7 x 36 or 252 jobs to run. Multiplying this by 300 we expect 75600 jobs to completein an hour.Since the two initial Workers will be insufficient to process the job list we have a mechanismfor increasing the number of Workers. When there are jobs waiting and no Workers available the SGE scheduler request that cfncluster spin up more instances. Cfncluster will do so until it hits the maximum limit (300) that we specified in the config file.These 300 Workers will each process multiple threads/tasks.  When the job queue is empty the Workers will be terminated; but not until after they have streamed their results back to the Master."

"body": "EC2 on AWSIntroductionThe purpose of this page is to go into some detail about the provisioning and use of AWS EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) virtual servers; which are just computers available for you to use.Links  EC2 Instance pricing  AWS Calculator  Elastic Block Storage  Elastic File System  AWS Security Groups  AWS training fundamentalsWarnings** There are two really important things to understand before you start using EC2 instances:1. Never place your access keys in a public repository such as GitHub.2. Never allocate EC2 resources and leave them running idle. This will cost you money. Learn to shut them down.**Informal introductionAn EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance is a computer; or you may prefer the term ‘virtual server’. It runs the Linux or Windows operating system just like a box under your desk might. However: If you need to increase your computing capacity or expand your storage: There are many many such EC2 instances available at a moment’s notice.Please refer to our read our Cloud Core drop-down for more on how cloud computing may be suitable for your project,Details and terminologyAmazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances come with a host of features and terminlogy. Briefly:  AMIs  Elastic Block Storage (EBS)  Snapshots of EBS volumes  EC2 Resources  Elastic File System (EFS)  Elastic IPs  Access keys and ‘Key Pairs’  S3 storage and accessSetting up an EC2 InstanceThe ‘compute’ part of the cloud begins with Virtual Machines that are called Elastic Cloud Compute = ECC = EC2 instances. To get started with EC2 instances you would log on to the AWS console, click on the EC2 icon and follow the buttons to create a new instance; which takes a few minutes. And then you can log in to that machine and use it like any other computer. It has an operating system that you choose, it has some amount of computing power that you choose, it has some amount of RAM that you choose and it has very little disk space.This is the big Aha: You also want to attach some disk space in the process as well. The generic term for disk space is a disk volume. You can attach these volumes (more than one is fine) in the spin-up process or you can attach them later. This is Elastic Block Storage (EBS). A single EBS volume can be up to 16 Terabytes.Let’s assume EBS is where you’ll keep your data; and so to safely make a back-up copy of that EBS volume you can periodically take snapshots of it. The snapshots bundle up all the stuff in the volume and put that (like a big zip file) in S3 storage. That storage is completely separate from the EC2 instance and its attached EBS volumes. You can also bundle up an image of the entire EC2 instance into storage. This is a snapshot combined with some additional instructions on setting up the instance; and together these comprise an AMI for Amazon Machine Image. So there are two levels of granularity in backing up your work: Snapshots and AMIs.Now how much does this cost? The EBS costs ten cents per GB-month. Storage costs three cents per GB-month; so if you have a lot of data this is considerable cost savings, putting your EC2 instance in storage by means of an AMI; or putting your disk volume in storage by means of a snapshot. The EC2 instance itself (not considering the cost of the EBS) will vary with which machine you chose. A cheap machine is free (T2.micro). A basic, simple low-power machine will cost three cents per hour. A fairly powerful machine will cost perhaps 40 cents per hour. You can also rent super-powerful machines for several dollars per hour. Since that adds up it is important to know that you can turn these machines off (without losing your data) so that you are not paying for them when you are not using them.What this page is / isn’tNow this document is in preparation; so it does not cover everything in this topic. For example it does not cover how to save money by using the Spot Market and it does not cover turning EC2 instances on and off and setting Alarms to inform you when they are possibly doing something expensive. We’ll build all of this into these documentation pages; but the main point of this page at the moment is Resources: The short list of items that you tend to build and associate with EC2 instances. This includes AMIs, Snapshots, Key Pairs, and Elastic IPs.Making an AMIAn EC2 instance: We take as a given. (Although we don’t have down “Encrypted” but let’s just flag that with kilroy. Notice I can create an AMI quite easily using the menu. Here is the configuration page:Resource OverviewReturning to the EC2 Resource summary: Let’s take a look at what’s what here term by term: In this region I’m not (apparently) running any instances.Elastic IPAn Elastic IP is a convenient persistent ip address associated with my account (and with a particular machine unless that machine gets blown away). It is said to be ‘publicly routable’: It is visible/findable on the internet.AWS will hand us some number of these on demand for very little money. If we do not request this, however, then the default is a temporary public ip address that is only good as long as the instance is up and running. Shut it down and that ip evaporates.An Elastic IP is persistent on my account and could even be detached and re-attached to something else. This is like having a piece of public plumbing at my dispoal to a resource that I want to share for example.  This ip stuff is distinct from a DNS entry. The latter is a person-friendly string associated with an ip address (free or maybe for a nominal fee).Dedicated HostA Dedicated Host is a physical computer which permits only me (my AWS account) to be connected. It does not thread in other virtual operating systems or other accounts.  This is an important concept in HIPAA compliance.SnapshotA Snapshot is always drawn from, i.e. is an image of some Elastic Block Storage (EBS). An 8GB Snapshot is quite likely the root volume of an AWS Linux EC2 instance. However if you attach more EBS – like say 2TB – to that instance you can make a separate larger Snapshot.AMIAn AMI is a Snapshot together with some instructions for standing up an EC2 instance. Hence: When you create an AMI part of that process is a Snapshot or Snapshots of all the EBS volumes associated with that instance.Snapshot to AMI Conversion in LinuxYou can “upgrade” a Snapshot to an AMI in Linux but it is more complicated for Windows. And this is a little bit vague: Do we mean that the snapshot is of the Root volume or an attached volume? The rebuilt AMI – in the case where the original AMI instructions are unavailable – will be built out rather generically. This is one of these digressions that can drive one crazy so let’s leave it there for now.Understanding a Snapshot listingWhen you look at your Snapshot listing:CreateImage is a facility for building an AMI. Fine. - …is an instance ID. - …is an AMI ID.Snapshot ArchaeologySuppose you have an old Snapshot and you are not sure what is on it; and if nothing you might want to delete it. Now can you look at it? If the associated AMI is gone you can always create a Volume from the Snapshot, Attach the Volume to some other EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone, mount the Attached Volume and peruse the file system in the usual way.  Maybe your important data is still there!Create the Volume from the SnapshotI will choose Magnetic because it is a bit cheaper… this is just an example. If I wish to have speed I would stay with SSD.The Volume is created very quickly.Here it is, now listed in the Volume table:PRO TIP: When you create a Volume from a Snapshot make sure it is in the same Availabilty Zone (AZ) as the Instance that you intend to attach it to. Failing to do so is a waste of time: You can’t attach a Volume in Oregon to an EC2 in Virginia. In fact you can’t attach a Volume in Virginia 1-a to an EC2 in Virginia 1-b.  Virginia is a Region, 1-a is the Availability Zone.That’s where my restored Volume is. Oh look I have a machine there also; though it is Stopped: Let us Start it.This finds a host, creates a VM, points to the associated storage all of this takes a few minutes but you can be impatient and see if you can Attach the restored Snapshot Volume whenever you like.Mounting the Attached VolumeTo check if there is an attached volume, log on (ssh) onto your EC2 instance (Original recipe located here.First see if it is attached with:&gt;&gt; sudo fdisk -lDisk /dev/xvdc: 10.7 GB, 10737418240 bytesThen format (if you haven’t already):&gt;&gt; sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdcCreate dir where it will be mounted:&gt;&gt;mkdir /dataMount it:&gt;&gt;sudo mount /dev/xvdc /dataCheck if it has been mounted correctly with:&gt;&gt;mount -l/dev/xvdc on /data type ext4 (rw)Make it mount automatically on system start&gt;&gt;sudo vim  /etc/fstabAdd:/dev/xvdc /data auto defaults,nobootwait 0 0That’s it. Make sure your read and write permissions are set accordingly using chmod.What is the Snapshot ID?Here is a screen capture of some volumes:Each is attached to an EC2 instance. Notice these have a snapshot ID. This means that these volumes were created from a snapshot, for example from an AMI = Snapshot + instructions. It does not mean that this snapshot still exists; or that if it did exist it would reflect what is actually in the restored volume. That volume probably has changed. So to explore these volumes:  Again we would ssh into the EC2 instance associated and go look at the file system.In the case above, by the way, as noted earlier: These are all tell-tale Linux OS root volumes because the default on AWS Linux EC2 instances is 8GB.Pro Tip: Returning to the snapshot table comment field (‘Created by… in our example above): This can have anything in there (User defined) when the snapshot is of an EBS without this AMI association business.***This concludes the overview of Snapshots and AMIs and the archaeological process of figuring out what is preserved on an artifact Snapshot.Key PairsIn the Resource summary table there is an entry for Key Pairs. Let’s cover what these are next. A Key Pair is both a public and a private key; and we will be primarily discussing the use of the private key file to authenticate into an AWS EC2 instance using the secure shell (ssh) protocol.Start up an EC2 instance. You need an initial way of getting in via ssh. Rather than use a password let’s use Key Pair authentication. I get the private Key file; and it contains JUST a private key: A long string of characters. Let’s not publish this on Github.When I authenticate using PuTTY I set it to use this private key. PuTTY uses the ‘.ppk’ version of the key but AWS only gives out a ‘.pem’ version of that file. No problem: There is a separate application called PuTTYGen that does the conversion. So procedurally:  Generate the EC2 instance  From the AWS Console: Get the key file associated.  Install both PuTTY and PuTTYGen (both will install in a PuTTY package)  Run PuTTYGen and convert the key file from .pem to .ppk format  Run PuTTY and use the .ppk file to log in to the instance.To ssh to this EC2 instance I will need to know what username to enter.  This can vary from one EC2 instance type (OS) to another. For example on an AWS-styled Linux machine the user name is ec2-user. On an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance the username is ubuntu.Now I have logged in to the machine using ssh. I can sudo anything I want. Success.How do I log in in the future? How do others log in? Three options:  I can use the key that I have and/or give that key to someone else.  I can generate a new key on that machine and share that key. This has nothing to do with AWS. I could do it with a script for example, using Linux commands.  I can enable logging in by username and password.Notice that sshis a secure (encrypted) tunnel through which these keys are passing.This security level is maintained as a separate effort by ssh / PuTTY. (PuTTY is the application and ssh is the cryptographic network protocol.)Ssh, PuTTY, scp and WinSCPNow that we have identified PuTTY as the ssh-using application let’s go a bit further. Ssh is also a Linux command for logging into another machine; so in a sense PuTTY is the Windows equivalent of the Linux ssh. Similarly there is a secure copy program in Linux called scp. The Windows analog is WinSCP.More on KeysKeys are actually generated in pairs: The public and private key pair are associated; and the public key can be openly shared. For more on this see this.On AWS I can only generate one key pair per machine. The private key recognition machinery is injected into the instance when it launches the first time; and I can start multiple instances using that same key. If I create an AMI and use that to generate many EC2 instances: Again just one private key provides access to all of them. One key can map to many EC2 instances in the context of AWS.Keys Versus S3 Access SharingLet’s take a moment to contrast Key-based access to an EC2 instance with the process of sharing files using S3 buckets. The latter is done using IAM permissions, specifically using a Bucket Policy.Sharing between AWS accounts is straightforward. If my friend has an AWS account then I just set that up in the S3 bucket policy by referring to his account number. So he has to send me that.Sharing with non-AWS-account holders is also easy and there are several options. If my collaborator has no AWS account I have three broad categories of approach: IAM User, Web Server and Signed URL.IAM User method: I get an Access Key and a Secret Key. I do not think this is the same thing as a Key Pair but I could be proven wrong. I receive these two keys for example when I create a User. They reside in a single credential file. I click “Download Credentials” and there it is in ASCII. The file is in CSV format and includes a user name, an access key and a secret key (all strings).There are three ways of getting to the S3 bucket now for that person.  Third party tool: Cloudberry, Cyberduck, etcetera  AWS command line interface (CLI)  An API call          Notice this does NOT involve the Web Console.                  They can only use the AWS Web Console if I generate a password for them using IAM.                    Put a web server / web app in front of the S3 bucket. This pushes the problem down a level, so to speak.  Generate a signed URL  Gives access to one object during the time-to-live associated with that URL.  This can be done on the CLI or in one of those applications (Cloudberry etc)  Look for the button that says ‘Generate signed URL’So now we have covered Key Pairs and differentiated Key Pair use from S3 access.Mounting an EBS to your InstanceFTP Setup and EC2 InstanceOverview: Create a virtual machine, install the ftp server and setup user accounts.Bonus: Bind your EC2 instance to an Elastic IP so you can reuse the same public IP even if your instance changes!      Sign up for a free AWS account here. Usage and free tier information available here.        This recipe from AWS is straightforward. Print it out and don’t skip a step. An EC2 (elastic compute cloud) is your virtual computing environment i.e. your virtual machine. This video by Microwave Sam expands on the EC2 setup.        Once your VM is ok you can securely tunnel via Mac Terminal, Linux ssh or Windows PuTTY.        You can set up an FTP server on your VM. Search stackoverflow for “setting up ftp server on amazon cloud”.        Test by connecting an FTP client to your FTP server. You may need to change directory permissions on the VM.  Elastic IPsStopping and re-starting EC2 instances can change the ip address. OVercome this using Elastic IP. You get a limited numberof these with your account; and you can request more. See the AWS user guide (kilroy link needed).Once you’ve associated the Elastic IP with a running instance, you can ssh into the VM with the Elastic IP but using the previous public key generated for the instance. Don’t forget to update the vsftpd.conf with your new Elastic IP address which is now your public address.&gt; sudo vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.confpasv_address=&lt;Elastic IP address&gt;&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restartMicrosoft Azure let’s you choose your own public DNS hostname which reduces the need for this workaround.DNS HostnamesIf you have your own registered domain, you can set your A-Record to point to the Elastic IP address of your instance. That gets rid of the unsightly public DNS that AWS assigns to you. Here’s the example for cloudmaven.org (our domain registrar is Namecheap.com):(link was broken; image should be put in images/az and referenced directly)An A-record points the hostname (here “compute”) to the AWS instance Elastic IP (here “52.41.144.22”). I can then ssh into my compute instance using ec2-user@compute.cloudmaven.org. You can also set up similarly an A record called ftp that points to the elastic IP of your ftp server instance to allow ftp access into say ftp.cloudmaven.org."

"summary": "A HIPAA-compliant research system on AWS",
"body": "IntroductionThis document presents a secure data management system, specifically using the motivation of managing Private Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA regulations on the public cloud. This template applies more generally to secure data management in research computing.HIPAA regulations require data be encrypted both at rest (e.g. on a storage device) and in transit (e.g. moving from one storage device to another).  Our hypothetical situation is described in further detail below; it is well to keep these rest/transit encryption notions in mind.Please note that while this study uses AWS we are also building out the construct on the Microsoft Azure public cloud.Links  HIPAA home page  HIPAA on Wikipedia  HIPAA Privacy Rule Summary  AWS HIPAA templateWarnings  AWS has nine HIPAA-aligned technologies. A HIPAA-compliant system on AWS means that only these technologies can come into contact with PHI.  Other technologies can be used in an ancillary capacity provided they do not interactdirectly with PHI data.  HIPAA compliance is an obligation placed on the data system builder and the medical researcher.The public cloud is very secure: physically and technologically. We contend that data system failure or compromise is most likely to be caused by human error.  File names may not include PHI. They may include identifier strings that would be indexed in a secure table.User story  A scientist K receives approval from an IRB to work with PHI data.          The intent is to analyze these data in a secure, HIPAA-compliant data system (herein HCDS)        K contacts a technology expert J and a research data provider S          Presenting a request for the approved data and a request for a cloud-based HCDS        Some due diligence and preparation ensue  K is given an ssh key to her HCDS          K logs on to the HCDS through a secure gateway      K carries out the data analysis over a period of time                  The system logs all activity                    IOT devices distributed to patients report health data to the HCDS                  These data supplement the research                      The study concludes          Sensitive data are stored to a secure archive      The HCDS is deleted      Log files are archived to preserve a complete record of operation for the HCDS      Plan of action for this HCDS Proof of Concept  Follow the existing notes/guidelines and translate into this document  Create a system architecture and diagram          Anticipate  pipeline      Anticipate  pipeline      Anticipate changes to  VM&gt; process        Create artificial data          data manufacturing software      generate source artificial data (from EMR)      generate IOT stream      anticipate study-to-clinical pipeline        Complete system including analytical tools          include R, Python, Jupyter        Review with IT personnel (J first)  Review with management  Review with researchersDetails to incorporate  Logging: CloudWatch and CloudXXXXX are AWS logging services; and this is frequently parsed using Splunk  Intrusion detection!

To clarify: Must the data be further encrypted at rest first?  Filenames may not include PHI. Hence there is an obligation on the MRs to follow this and/or build it into file generation.

We also make extensive use of very short abbreviations (just about every entity gets one, indicated by boldface and obsessive re-naming of everything using the Project Identifier Tag (PIT)Initial steps  Absolute First Priority Step 0: Designate to AWS that this account involves PHI/HIPAA data          kilroy action to Aaron: How to do find this out?!        Keep in mind: Suppose this is a multi-day effort: Shut down instances to save moneyOur objective is (see Figure below kilroy) to use a Laptop or other cloud-external data sourceto feed data into a HIPAA-Compliant Data System (HCDS) wherein we operate on that data. The data are assumed to be Private Health Information (PHI).  Write down or obtain a Project Identifier Tag (PIT) to use in naming/tagging everything          In our example here PIT = ‘hipaa’. Short, easy to read = better        Identify our source computer as L, a Laptop sitting in a coffee shop          This is intentionally a non-secure source      We return to this issue later (kilroy make sure we do please)      L does not have a PIT      L could also be a secure resource operated by Med Research / IRB / data warehouse      We are starting with a data source and will return to encryption later. The first burst of activity will be the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS per the diagramabove (kilroy). We assume you have done Step 0 above and are acting in the capacity of asystem builder; but you may not be an experienced IT professional. You are building this environment, you may or may not necessarily be doing research.The easiest way to create a VPC is using the console Wizard. That method is covered in a section below.  The method we use here is manual to help illuminate the components.Diagram notes  AWS is the big box  VPC is inside  Public and Private subnets are inside VPC  NAT gateway inside the Public subnet box  Internet Gateway on boundary of VPC  S3 Endpoint on boundary of VPCTo continue on first stepsCIDR block syntax: The specification 10.0.0.0/16 has two parts: w.x.y.z and /N. The first part defines an ip address with three wildcards, the zeros.  N indicates number of addresses available: 2(32 - N). When N = 16 this is 216 or 65536. This is two bytes so y and z are usable to cover.  Hence 10.0.0.0/16 means “addresses of the form 10.0.y.z”. Any subnets we place within the VPC will be limited by this address space.  We will define two subnets within the VPC each with respective CIDR ranges: Subranges of the VPC CIDR block.  A subnet with CIDR = 10.0.1.0/24 has 256 addresses of the form 10.0.1.z.  From each subnet AWS grabs a few ip addresses: .0, .1, .2, .3, .255; so on a /24 only 251 addresses remain; for example 10.0.1.4, 10.0.1.5,10.0.1.6, …, 10.0.1.254.  On AWS create a VPC V          Give V a PIT name      V will not use IPv6v.  This makes matters simpler.      V will have a CIDR block defining an ip address space                  We use 10.0.0.0/16                    V automatically has a routing table RT                  After creating V: Select Routing Tables, sort by VPC and give RT a PIT name                          Here: ‘hipaa_routingtable’              The routing table is a logical mapping of ip addresses to destinations                                          V automatically has a security group SG                  After creating V: Select Security Groups, sort by VPC and give SG a PIT name                          Here: ‘hipaa_securitygroup’                                          V will have both public and private subnets                  The private subnet Si is where work on PHI proceeds                          CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24              Si will be firewalled behind a NAT gateway                                The public subnet Su is for internet access                          CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24              Su will connect with the internet via an Internet Gateway              Su will be home to the Bastion server B              Su will be home to the NAT Gateway NG                                  B and NG are on the public subnet but also have private subnet ip addresses                                          That is: Everthing on the public subnet also has a private ip address in the VPC.                      This will obviously chew up the private ip address range capacity                      Public names will resolve to private addresses within the VPS at need.                      kilroy need a remark on how this works, collision avoidance                                                                                                              After creating V create an associated Flow Log FL                  As of March 2017 the UI is a little tetchy so be prepared to go around twice          Click the Create Flow Log button                          Assuming permissions are not set: Note the Hypertext to set up permissions                                  This is because we need to define the proper Role                  So click on this hypertext                  On the Role creation page: Give the Role a PIT name; Create new; Allow                  You now have an IAM Role for FlowLogs                                          This gives the account the necessary AWS permissions to work with Flow Logs                      In so doing we fell out of the Create Flow Log dialog so… back around                                                                                  Return to the VPC in the console              Click on Create Flow Log                                  Filter = All is required (not “accepted” and not “rejected” traffic)                  Role: Select the role we just created above                  Destination log group: Give it a PIT name                                          We use hipaa_loggroup                                                                                                                On V create subnets Su and Si          Note that Create VPC does give us the option of creating a VPC with a pre-built pub/priv…                  See below for more on this faster template-driven approach                    Note: The console column for subnets shows “Auto-assign Public IP” and this should be Yes for our public subnet (note column name includes Public IP). The Private subnet should have this setto No. If necessary change these entries using the “Subnet Actions” button.Note: We must be able to make new EC2 instances on the private subnet that by default do not havea public IP address. In this way we do not accidentally expose a Wi instance (worker) to publicaccess; so this tremendously important. kilroy need a link to where we come back to this and solve.In the subnet table there is a “Default Subnet” column which is a boolean. In this example bothSu and Si  have this set to No so there is no default subnet. We fix this later.The fix happens in the routing table RT which is built into the VPC.  Give RT a PIT-name hipaa_routingtable          This is a global VPC-wide routing table; it can be superseded by a subnet’s routing table      The VPC routing table RT reads:10.0.0.0/16 points to the VPC \"local\" stuf0.0.0.0/0 points to the NAT gateway and to the InternetSu has a routing table (PIT name is hipaa_public_routingtable)  which has 10.0.0.0/16 0.0.0.0/0 Internet gatewayBefore creating more RTs we need an Internet Gateway IGThis is easily done and also attach hipaa_internetgateway to hipaa the VPCso Create Route Table: hipaa_publicsubnet on the hipaa VPCGo to Subnet Associations tab for this RTedit this to do subnet association with the public subnet. Obviously. So RT &gt; Subnet &gt; VPC  call this hipaa_publicroutes Go to Routes tab for this RT  For this RT Edit (under Routes) and add 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the IGNow add the NAT Gateway; and then we will modify the main RT to point to this  - There may be some Elastic IP assignment voodooWE now have two RTs. VPC and Public. VPC 0-entry points at the NAT Gateway: All internet-trafficwill route through the NAT.Public subnet has a custom RT which says “all non-local traffic goes out to the IG.” = The Internet.This has precedence over the main table which sends to NAT.By default the Private subnet will use the VPC RT to go to the NAT. Like one’s Router at home. This allows the private network to talk to the Internet and the Internet can’t talk to my private subnet.      Create an Internet Gateway IG        Create a NAT Gateway NG        On V create a public-facing Bastion Server B          B has only port 22 open (ssh)      B uses Secure Groups on AWS to limit access to only a subset of URLs      kilroy establish that a second key K2 provides secure access to B      kilroy establish the chain of custody of K2      might B be from an AMI?      m4.large running AWS Linux: Created.

We are now configuring the S3 Endpoint.   In so doing we selected the VPC RT (not the public subnet RT; could use that)  We are concerned about S3 traffic  S3 Endpoint is a new type of Gateway that gives S3 access from Private subnet direct into S3 without any traverse of the internet.WARNING: Kilroy: After I added the S3 Endpoint the NAT gateway entry had vanished from my VPC routing table. This is bad. Right now the procedure is going to be: After S3 EP go examine RT and re-add NAT gateway if it is not properly present. holy cow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Created S3 bucketEncryptionSuppose on EC2 we create an EBS volume for the PHISo is the “comes with” EBS volume encrypted?

So that’s done.Working with your own set of keys would be part of risk management: Should the keys be compromised etcetera.So there is some additional hassle and so on but some potential risk management. Due diligence: kilroy check the DLT account T&amp;C; and generally “who is responsible for the risk?”The question is: Do we want to use one key across multiple environments (the default) or created new keys for each new envvironment?

"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this page is to overview AWS-based (EC2) approaches to creating and using Jupyter notebooks, We describe a standard server-based approach with some shareability features and a personal approachwhich makes use of an ssh tunnel. The latter is also described on this technical page.Aside from AWS you can also create a static Jupyter notebook on GitHub, you can clone a Jupyter repo fromGitHub and you can also explore the option described here.Links  Jupyter notebooks  AWS Jupyter Server instructions  Our middle-school math club demo notebookWarningsWe outline two EC2-based approaches here, shared and non-shared. The shared form is a nice collaboration tool but has two drawbacks: First you share **write** access with anyone you givethe password to and second (in early 2017 anyway) there is some browser security complaining that you must push past. This seems a bit sketchy.Before startingIn the introduction above we mention five approaches to using Jupyter notebooks.  Here we concentrate on the first two of these, both on EC2 instances.Approach one: Personal Jupyter notebook, ssh tunnelSuppose you need a Jupyter notebook for your own research; you do not need to share it with anyone. You create an EC2 instance, get the .pem key pair file, install Jupyter on the instanceand that’s it, you are ready to go… except that you don’t have an obvious way of getting the Jupyter notebook to appear in a browser (because it the Jupyter server is running remotely). The solution: ssh tunneling as described here.You may encounter errors where the port on your local machine had previously been opened and you cannot reuse the port. In this case, you can check opened ports on local machine by using this command:sudo lsof -i :port numberYou must close the port before you can reuse it.Approach two: A shared Jupyter notebookSuppose that you would like to share access to a Jupyter notebook on an EC2 instance with a few colleaguesvia a URL and a simple password. Follow the directions given  here  or hereApproach two has two differences from Approach one: First your colleagues can edit the notebook files. (It may be wise to periodically back them up.) Second as of 2017 the connectionseems to be non-secure and a bit sketchy.Our notes on Approach TwoThe links we give above or a quick internet search are quite possibly better resources than ournotes given here.  Spin up an AWS instance with Ubuntu AMI and install Anaconda  Install Jupyter Notebook% sudo apt-get install jupyter-notebookOnce you’ve installed Jupyter Notebook, follow the steps below:% jupyter notebook --generate-config Then launch ipython and generate a hashed password to add to the configuration file you generated:% ipythonIn [1]: from notebook.auth import passwdIn [2]: passwd()Enter password:Verify password:Out[2]: 'sha1:--long_string_of_characters--'The “sha1:–string–” is a hashed password. It is used below in a configuration file.Generate a self-signed certificate using openssl so that your hashed password is encrypted$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mykey.key -out mycert.pemSet Jupyter Notebook to use the certificate when it starts:$ jupyter notebook --certfile=mycert.pem --keyfile mykey.keyYou can also set the Jupyter Notebook to use the certificate when it starts by editing the configuration file:$ vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.pyYou will want to add the following lines to the config file (or uncomment those lines – remove the hashes):# Set options for certfile, ip, password, and toggle off# browser auto-openingc.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mycert.pem'c.NotebookApp.keyfile = u'/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mykey.key'# Set ip to '*' to bind on all interfaces (ips) for the public serverc.NotebookApp.ip = '*'c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:--long_string_of_characters--'c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False# It is a good idea to set a known, fixed port for server accessc.NotebookApp.port = 9999Note: You must open port 9999 on the EC2 instance. You can do this from the AWS console using the Security Groups and Inbound rules.Note: If http://ipaddress:9999 doesn’t work, use https://ipaddress:9999.Creating Alarms for Jupyter Notebook Servicekilroy this part is not in place yet; see source nbkJupyter notebook auto-restartThis is how you manually start / stop a Jupyter server:% sudo service jupyter start% sudo service jupyter stopYou may also want to delve into the difference between these two commands:% jupyter notebook% nohup jupyter notebookThe first will halt when you log off the machine; the second uses ‘nohup’ to make the process persist in the background so you can log out. (‘nohup’ is short for no hang-up; a holdover fromphone modem days.)This manual starting and stopping can get tedious (tm Isabella Boom); so this section describes how to set your Jupyter notebook server to start automatically on reboot.  As noted your EC2 instance mayrestart as often as every couple days or so.  The notes below assume the Jupyter notebook server is installed through Anaconda.  It assumes that you have an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.Download this script and save it on your EC2 instance as /etc/init.d/jupyter.  Edit this file to make this modification:&gt; DAEMON=/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/bin/jupyter-notebookMake sure there is a /var/log/jupyter/ folder. If necessary create one using sudo mkdir.Issue the following sequence from the command line: Respectively these make the init.d file executable, generate a Jupyter config file, and update the rc process to include your Jupyter service.Once this is done you can reboot the instance and make sure the Jupyter service starts properly.% sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/jupyter% sudo jupyter --generate-config -f /etc/jupyter/jupyter_config.py% sudo update-rc.d jupyter defaults"

"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this document – available at http://cloudmaven.org – is to narrate a common experience:  “First time using the AWS cloud” by making you the observer of a research graduate student, Pearl by name, who goes through that process. Pearl’s situation is a fairly common pattern: She has a large amount of data processing in mind for her work and she has written some necessary software in Python. There is more on this below. The point is she wants to get onto the cloud and get back to running her code on the data as quickly as possible. She has taken on an additional task as well: Pearl will manage the cloud account for the entire research group so she will need some additional skills.(Note this document is under construction, incomplete, missing bits flagged with ‘kilroy’)ObjectivesDay One (this document)  Discover the AWS Console and decouple the account from a billing    account  Receive research credits for this account (and manage a    ‘gap’ time interval)  Look briefly at getting a machine  Do some    initial account administration tasksDay Two and so on…  Choose and spin up an EC2    instance (cloud computer); add some memory  Connect to the EC2    instance with ssh and scp; shutdown the instance, start it again  Add generic software and custom software and some data  Do some    simple tests and create both a snapshot and an AMI of the EC2    instance  See if the code can do an intensive job… and diagnose any    problems  Get the code to run in parallel  Spin up a cluster of machines, do a parallel run  Figure out how much this should have cost and how much it did cost  Calculate what a large processing run will costDiscover the AWS Console and decouple the account from a billing accountThe lead faculty member for this project is David; who some time ago received an AWS cloud account. This account was linked to another account that acted as a Master Account for purposes of creating a single point of billing. To receive his research credits David will have to decouple his account from that Master Account. We follow Pearl as she breaks this link.Log in as David: Given his account name and his password. The URL is kilroy. Kilroy screencap.Notice that Pearl is now looking at the main AWS console featuring 50+ icons, each with a short text description.Only a few of these icons come into play here; the rest can be ignored or explored at a future date. This console is like the factory floor where one starts to build. Pearl takes a minute to look at some of the icons and some of the text.However: To un-link this account she needs to leave the factory floor – the AWS Console – and go into the ‘office’ where the account is managed. That is, we want to go to the My Account page, typically from the identity dropdown at the upper right.To see this left-side list of context pages:Now that Pearl is on this page she notices the above, a recurring feature of the AWS console: In a given context on the AWS console website there will be a useful menu on the left side. Here we want to select Consolidated Billing. If this account is linked to a ‘bigger’ account there is a button here to Remove account. This is what Pearl will do so that David’s account will be eligible to receive research credits.Receive research credits for this account (and manage a ‘gap’ time interval)Recall that Pearl is logged in as David, but more specifically she is logged in as the Account Manager, the person who has the top level of permissions for this account. David has been awarded $8k in research credits and those research credits are not real dollars; they can only be burned (used) from this AWS account. However those credits will not be awarded until the first day of the following month where today is the 12th of this month. So let’s see how Pearl is going to manage this.Pearl goes to the Dashboard selection for My Account where she can see the account number. She sends an email to the AWS research credit manager telling her both the email address and the account number associated with this account. She receives a confirmation that the research credits will be available on the first of next month. Now Pearl can either wait 19 days or she can incur some charges while she learns how to use the AWS cloud. She chooses the latter since paying for 19 days of cloud use will ultimately be David’s problem. (And just to be sure she checks with David who says it is ok.)Now Pearl opens up a notes file and starts taking notes on what she is doing. The notes file is kept in a secure location on her computer that is not part of any source code version control repository. This ensures that Pearl’s notes are not accidentally shared to the internet: They may contain exploitable information. Let’s refer to this as Pearl’s Secure Location. In addition to notes she can keep Credential files here. At least initially she will be acting as the Account Administrator for the entire research team. This role is not the same as Account Manager described above.  The Account Manager might have financial matters to deal with at some point but is largely not involved in the operation of this AWS account. The Account Administrator will track spending and make sure that all of the other account Users are following good practices.At this point the AWS Solution Architect – a person from Amazon who knows how everything works – is asking Pearl to follow protocol regarding this account: He wants her to create a new User and log out and log back in as that User. However she is going to ignore him for the moment and go look at machine instances (computers she can use).Look briefly at getting a machinePearl returns to the AWS Console by clicking on the cube icon at the upper left. She notices the item called EC2; so she clicks on that.An EC2 instance is the AWS term for a computer. AWS has a large number of these available; they comprise the compute power of the Amazon cloud. Each EC2 instance will have associated memory (RAM) just like any other computer. EC2 instances also have some amount of disk space associated, large enough to host the machine’s operating system. To attach additional disk space – known as Elastic Block Storage (EBS) – is a common task; but there is a fee that is proportional to the amount of disk space that you attach; so it is typical to get what you need and not more.   See http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/amazons-elastic-block-store-explained.Pearl notices that she has no instances currently in operation; and that there is a button calledShe clicks on this and finds that the first choice in getting a machine is to choose the operating system. She chooses AWS Linux.This is a version of Linux that is aligned with other AWS technologies. The login username for this OS is ec2-user; and Pearl will use this account name but without a password. Rather she will be using an authentication certificate.Pearl finds that the second choice she has is machine type.There is a list provided of about 45 choices, from small ‘t-class’ machines to large ‘x-class’ machines. Rather than go further with starting up a machine Pearl cancels out of this and returns to the AWS Console. It’s time to follow protocol.Do some initial account administration tasksIn order to avoid logging in as Account Administrator (which has the highest level of control over the account) Pearl is now going to use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) page to create two new identities or IAM Users. The icon for IAM Management looks like a key.(this example is from the ‘uwcloudczar’ account, not Pearl/David’s account.)Now that she is in the IAM page Pearl notices again the left sidebar context menu. Pearl is now going to create an IAM User identity for herself and for David. She clicks on Users and selectsShe adds account names ‘pearl’ and ‘david’.These will be two new IAM Users under this account. Each User receives four additional points of attention to complete this task.  Assign each User an Administrator Policy  Assign each User a Password Login  Require each User to activate Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)  Train each User on using this account.Including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in an IAM User AccountPearl asks David to install an MFA application on his smart phone. This app is provided by AWS at not cost:Pearl then selects David’s IAM User account and selects the Action ‘Manage MFA device’ which goes here:The smartphone app is a Virtual MFA device. You can also purchase dedicated small devices for this purpose but we tend to avoid them as they are “one more thing to keep track of”. The Next Step button leads toFrom here there is a step that we do not screen-cap. It is a window with a QR code that you photographwith the phone and two code entry fields. You put two consecutive 6-digit codes into those fields to continue.This should be sufficient to activate MFA access for this IAM User.Other items from aboveKilroy please attend to other bullets in the above listLast steps for Day OnePearl now logs out of the AWS Console: She is no longer the Account Manager. She has received a login URL as part of her login credentials; so she types this URL into her browser and at the prompts enters her IAM User name ‘pearl’ and her password. This takes her to an MFA page where she enters a six digit code. From here she finds herself back at the AWS Console page with Administrator privileges. That is: She is now logged in as her IAM User self, an Administrator; not as the Account Manager.David would do likewise to do work under this account; as would everyone else on the research team. This work is not done when logged in as the Account Manager; only when logged in as IAM Users. Each IAM User has their own username, password and MFA activated. This information should be kept secure to prevent giving non-team-members access to the account. Again: This includes keeping this information away from code management repositories such as GitHub.Choose and spin up an EC2 instance (cloud computer); add some memoryPearl now decides to go back to EC2 and actually start up an EC2 instance. She returns to the EC2 page. At the top are listed a set of EC2 Resources, for example:We describe EC2 Resources in more detail under that subject heading. One of the most useful EC2 resources to be aware of is the Elastic IP.   This is a persistent ip address that you can associate with an EC2 instance even if you shut it down and start it up again. Without this feature an EC2 that you stop and re-start will be assigned a new IP address each time, making it a bit of a moving target if you need to ssh to that instance.Pearl again clicks on the Start EC2 Instance button, selects AWS Linux as the operating system, and looks through the resulting set of instance options. These have corresponding on-demand cost rates as described at this link:http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demandThere are ways of cutting cost that are not described here. That is: You can realize considerable savings at AWS paying as low as only 10% of on-demand rates; for example see the documentation concerning the AWS Spot Market. For now Pearl will pay the on-demand rate. She chooses an r3.2xlarge instance which will cost $0.67 per hour. This is a powerful machine with 8 virtual CPUs. (kilroy put cost analysis here? If so include spot)Connect to the EC2 instance with ssh and scp; shutdown the instance, start it againDay Two and beyond  Add generic software and custom software and some data  Do some simple tests and create both a snapshot and an AMI of the EC2 instance  See if the code can do an intensive job… and diagnose any problems  Get the code to run in parallel  Spin up a cluster of machines, do a parallel run  Figure out how much this should have cost and how much it did cost  Calculate what a large processing run will cost"

Jupyter notebooks support Python, R, F Sharp, Julia and other programming languages. They also support markdown including LaTeX mathematical formatting.Microsoft to their immense credit has created a Jupyter notebook hosting service on their Azure cloud platform. This has two advantages over hosting a Jupyter notebook on a machine that you manage: First Azure takes care of the basics of managing the notebook and its host machine; so you don’t.  Second the Azure Jupyter notebook is connected to other useful technogies;so it is already built into a broader technical context or ecosystem. These extensions include Azure Machine Learning Studio and GitHub, just to begin with.

In particular thelink above on data loading tells you how to use !curl to load data from GitHub; and you may also want toavail yourself of ‘!conda install’ at the top of a particular notebook to make sure your added libraries are in place.  **  * When your notebook shuts down any data you have uploaded will evaporate. It does not persist. We have an entiresection below called ‘Rehydration’ on how to deal with this by parking the necessary files on GitHub. Please note: GitHub does have file size restrictions so you may need to resort to other means.*RehydrationAs of spring 2017 Azure Jupyter notebooks do not persist data that you upload when the Notebook shuts down. This means that you have to “rehydrate” your data supply when you re-start; but this can be done with an initialization cell running Python as follows:An Azure Jupyter notebook cell executing Python can run Linux commands by prefacing them withan exclamation mark ‘!’. In particular you can use the Linux curl command to inhale files (particularly in our case: Smallish data files and important figures, say .png files)to the current Notebook session from GitHub. The GitHub URL to use is not necessarily easy to find; so let’s place it right here.The key information is as follows:My github account is 'my_username'My repository is called 'my_reponame'My branch is 'my_branchname'My file is 'my_filename.png'The curl command to retrieve this to /nbuser/home (where it will be called file0001.png) is:!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my_username/my_reponame/my_branchname/my_filename.png -o file0001.png"

"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this page is to describe a data system for organic chemistry research, specifically for physical and spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) obtained from samples of the earth’s hydrosphere.LinksWarningsOverviewIn 2010 one of us (RF) began working with a group of geochemists (AS, RS, TD, JN, RS, HM) to build a systemon the Microsoft technology stack that would advance the state of the art of research in the earth’s global carbon cycle.  Specifically the scientists recognized that there were two important functions that a centralized, standardized data system could potentially provide: Perfunctory data processing and a large collective pool of queryable samples.To provide a sense of the research we present a brief scientific digression.The earth’s hydrosphere is all of the water on earth in its many locations from the bottom of the Antarctic ice sheet to water vapor suspended in the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the oceans to the permafrost of Siberia to the mud on the banks of the Great Grey Greasy Limpopo River (all set about with fever trees) to the glaciers of the Himalayas to the damp soil of the Hoh rainforest… and on and on. All of this water bears the fingerprints of its history in the form of dissolved carbon-bearing molecules. These molecules generally reflect metabolic processes of life on earth at all scales from microbial to macroscopic as well as physical effects such as degredation due to the sun’s ultraviolet rays. The common denominator in this picture is the storage and transport of carbon in what is called the global carbon cycle.  Carbon is stored in the earth system in reservoirs that include soil, oceans, sediment, rock, atmosphere, surface water and ice. It is transported and transformed between reservoirs by physical, chemical and biological processes at various rates. The aggregate of medium-to-small carbon molecules with life-based or organic structure are referred to as DOM for Dissolved Organic Carbon.The current state-of-the-art in analysis of DOM found in water samples involves spectral methods, three in particularin the work described here. By ‘spectral analysis method’ we mean a procedure that generates from one water sample aseries of values associated with one or more spectral parameters such as wavelength. As an example if one were studying rain rather than DOM one might measure the intensity of a rainbow across all of its colors; by wavelength.Let’s consider spectral DOM data generated in the course of a single research project.  If a particular field campaign produced one thousand water samples and each of these sampels yielded 400,000 data values across three spectral methods then the project will have produced 400 million data values that must be stored and analyzed. Typical reduction methods applied to these data might be applied iteratively many times over the course of two or three years resulting in three or four research papers; where the conclusions therein would emerge from patterns and structures discovered in that data.The problem is this: The scientists are extremely adept at imagining forms of data analysis that have not yet been implemented. They are able to see how other scientists in related field could make use of this data. They wouldlike those scientists to have direct, unfettered access to the spectral DOM data without any human interventionbeing necessary.  And finally our scientists are able to envision the power of combining datasets from multiple sampling projects to create a deeper body of data to analyze. But none of these imagined pathways can be implemented because the data are simply too complex and unwieldy in their traditional form to support these advances in DOM-drivenresearch.The task therefore falls to technologists (including these same scientists) to build a data management system that makes all of these imagined advances a reality. This, simply put, is the objective of our DOM data system project.User InterfaceDownload PDF hereAPIQueryDownload PDF hereData EgressDownload PDF hereMetadataDownload PDF hereMATLAB FunctionsDownload PDF hereEEMsDownload PDF here"

"summary": "Compute power in the cloud",
"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this page is to describe in some depth the available processing power on the public cloud.There is an ‘effectively unlimited’ pool of computers available on the public cloud, a reservoir you cantap to address your computing tasks.LinksAWS Instance Types[Azure Virtual Machine types] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/)Warnings  Cloud accounts initially limit the number of virtual machines you can allocate to prevent youfrom accidentally running up a huge bill. Only ask for this limit to be raised when you are certainyou know what you are doing.Basic ThesisWe develop here a framework for describing and tackling large computing tasks on the cloud. This includes drawing a distinction between available instance types or cloud VMs (Virtual Machines). (See the cloudmaven overview page and the glossary for the basic terminology.) In general the more powerful the cloud VM the more it costs per hour. At the same timeit will complete a given task more quickly; so there is the potential to benchmark different instancetypes to find an optimal solution. To first order you can probably skip this, however, in favor of simply understanding how to match your instance choice to your compute task.Incidentally: On the AWS cloud you may cut your costs using the Spot market; this detail is not discussed further on this page.Your cloud account may have a native limit to how many VMs you can engage at one time. If thisis insufficient for your work you can contact the cloud vendor and request a limit increase. Thisshould be granted fairly quickly but be warned: The reason that limit is in place to begin with isto prevent you from accidentally allocating a large number of cloud VMs and thereby running up a large bill. If your objective is to run a large number of VMs at once you should proceed in powers of ten (3 to 30 to 300 to 3000) to make sure that your ensemble is behaving as you expect.There are two extremes of large compute task, roughly speaking; which we call HPC and HTC. HPC stands for High Performance Computing and in a narrow definition it refers to tasks spread across many VMs which require inter-VM communication. The classic example is a solution to a computational fluid dynamics problem in which a volume is subdivided among VMs or ‘nodes’. In this case a particular cell may evolve over one time step and must share its new boundaryconditions with another node concerned with an adjacent cell. This requires all of the nodesto proceed in lockstep as the system evolves in time, where each tick of the clock requires aperiod of inter-node communication. This is typically done using special purpose hardware such as Infiniband. (kilroy citation needed)On the cloud this kind of inter-node communication speed is an emerging technology. The state of the art is rapidly changing and (kilroy need more here) you will want to look at the cloud vendorwebsites to see what is currently available.The other extreme for large compute tasks are those in which inter-node communication is not abottleneck. This is referred to as High Throughput Computing or HTC. It is also sometimes calledembarrassingly parallel computing, and by other euphemistic names. The positive feature of thistype of computing is that multiple tasks can be started on multiple nodes. These can run to completion and report back their end results. These results are ultimately collated into somesynthesis process to arrive at an end result. As an example see our AWS case study on Rosetta.This spectrum of HPC to HTC gives an important element of our large compute task framework. In the HTC case we can manage large numbers of parallel jobs using a Scheduler such as Sun Grid Engine. In principle any compute task can be completed in roughly the same amount of timeby simply allocating more nodes.  In the HPC case we have a more complex situation and therefore more work to do to ensure thata inter-node communication is not creating a bottleneck.Threads, vCPUs, hyperthreading, blades and all that jazzMachine characteristicsDistinction between metal and various VM configurationsAWS view: General purpose, compute-intensive, memory-intensive, burst, othersAzure view of thingsGPU-centricTop of the line VMsAttached drive strategiesEBSEFSBuckets and blobsHPC and interconnection speed"

"summary": "Cost of moving research computing to the cloud",
"body": "IntroductionThis page describes the cost of putting research computing on the public cloud. In the Proposals section of cloudmaven we have a more tactical page which may also be of interest.Links  The cloudmaven page on cost estimation for research proposal writingWarnings  It is commonly asserted that the cloud does not compare in cost to purchasing your own hardware. We make the case here that this assertion is false.How much does the cloud cost?A quick answer is “3 cents per GB-month of storage, 3 cents for an hour of CPU time”. This is something we will qualify and expand upon here;but for the sake of getting started those are useful numbers to keep in mind.Qualifiers  A powerful multi-core machine costs between 30 cents to one dollar per hour (with further qualifiers)  The storage cost for archival is currently 0.4 cents per GB-month at AWS.Total cost of ownership (TCO)If you purchase a computer you are done paying for the hardware; so we present three tiers of effective cost that factor in your time.  You bought it; you (or someone) maintains the system by installing patches and upgrades. You (or someone) provides space, power and does back-ups.  You pay for it on the cloud: The cloud provider does the care and maintenance. You just use the system.  You pay for a service on the cloud: You don’t even use the system; you just use the service.To elaborate further: A VM on the cloud is not something you … kilroy left off hereand you can use it until it fails; hopefully for 2 or more years. Then you need to purchase another computer. This is the traditional computing model and it makes sense if your machines are adequate to your computing needs provided that someone can pay for the electricity and cooling and someone has the time to maintain the operating system; and provided you have a good back-up strategy in case something bad happens. Cloud computing costs money but eliminates a lot of these ongoing maintenance tasks. Cloud computing resources are billed using a utility model: You pay for what you use.Cost is managed by turning off resources when they are not in use; and by carefully managing how many machines are in use when running jobs. Both of these tasks can be associated with automatic alarms that can prevent cloud usage from getting out of control and expensive.See also the section below on cloud research credits, a way to mitigate the cost of learning if the cloud works for you.Cloud Research CreditsThere are at least four approaches open to you:      Cloud novice approach: Get a $100 free credit account on AWS or a $200 free credit account on Microsoft Azure. Both require you to enter credit card info. This is like giving your hotel your credit card in case you break the TV.        You need some substantial compute power Today: Contact us by email. We may be able to quickly (within a few hours) set you up with a temporary User account. You will need to coordinate your usage with us; we will need to make sure you are proficient at managing resources; and we will ask that you do some reporting on your experience. This can be a short-term stop-gap.        You need some serious compute power for a year at no cost (requires 2 months to set up): Fill out the one-page application here for AWS or the one-page application here for Microsoft Azure. On approval you can receive up to $20k in research credits for a year. Both public clouds are excellent so we do not recommend one over the other. Come visit our office hours if you would like to disucss relative merits further.        You need some serious compute power and you have a budget: Contact UW IT to set up a purchase order. This will take a couple of days.  "

Cloud account: A virtual entity with permission to use a particular public cloud with an associated billing mechanism. The cloud account is used to appropriate and release resources which have associated billing rates. For example a cloud account might include a virtual machine that runs continuously for one month at a rate of ten cents per hour. At the end of one month this resource would incur a $72 charge.        Container: An abstraction in which a compute environment is placed. See ‘Docker container’.

Elastic: Commonly used as shorthand for “available in large quantities on request” to emphasize that you canallocate extensive computing resources on the cloud when needed and then relinquish them when no longerneeded. As an idealized example: Suppose a parallelizable compute job requires 100 hours on your machine. On the cloud you can appropriate 100 such computers at once and complete the job in 1 hour.        Endpoint: A connection point for a data signal.        GitHub AWS version: kilroy        Group: A virtual association of resources within a cloud account.

NIC: kilroy        That thing on AWS that is a NIC: kilroy        Policy: kilroy        Project: Shorthand for a body of work within a research program, assumed to have some computational elements.        RDS: Database service on AWS        Role: kilroy        S3: Storage on AWS        Scheduler kilroy        Server: A Computers acting as an information resource. More extensively a server can be thought of asa compute entity acting as the distal resource in a server-client relationship. Servers typically “listen” for signals and respond. There is implicitly a multi-layered underlying infrastructure that manages the “how” of these communication exchanges, from wires and voltages up through communication protocols.        Snapshot        Spot Market:        Thing: AWS, an entity that can have a Role.        Third Party: A company or other entity – but not a cloud provider – which builds and provides something useful to you (the first party) related to research computing and perhaps relevant to a cloud platform (provided by a second party). Example: The PuTTY ssh application is third party software that facilitates connecting to cloud VMs on Windows.        Utility model:        VM: Virtual machine (traditional term). We use the term here to indicate a computer; usually a computer operated by a public cloud vendor. On AWS a VM is called an EC2 instance.    VPC: Virtual Private Cloud (AWS)"

"body": "IntroductionThis purpose of this page is to present you with important technical details of cloud computing.Links  AWS EC2 instance type details  Install the AWS CLI  Example ssh usage/help  Computer networking port  Linux cURL command  Access to Jupyter notebooks via ssh  PuTTY on WikipediaWarnings  The material on this page can be incredibly useful but out of context may appear a bit ‘so what?’; we suggest skimming through here to help build your cloud context web if these topics are new to you.  Our glossary may help with unfamiliar terms.  Be warned! We have placed – where appropriate – smaller “Warnings” sections below with each sub-topic.Virtual MachinesHow fast is a given instance?  You can read about instance types on the vendor’s cloud console and/or information pages. For example AWS EC2 instances are written up here.  Here are a couple ways to look at CPU details from the command line of a Linux machine:% lscpu% cat /proc/cpuinfoIt is possible that (from evidence circa 2012) a certain degree of CPU type heterogeneity can introduce on the order of 10% performance variation.Data transfer to cloud storageTo AWS S3Run the ingress (local to S3) transfer in parallel on a wired connection (not WiFi). Being peered with a highspeed netwokr like Internet2 helps; or being in a Science DMZ environment is better still. If the data is going to the Oregon region of AWS: It might not save any time to go from Portland to Seattle and back toPortland again. Finally: You can use the console (browser) but the risk is that this will be slow.  On the otherhand you can use the AWS command line; e.g. the cp command. There are GUI-based interfaces like Cyberduckas well.  Note the AWS CLI installation page; this includes making sure the cli is in your path.Ports, sockets and tunnelingFollowing a URL such as 123.213.101.102 you may see a colon followed by a number, as in: 123.213.101.102:8001. This following number is a port, per wikipedia ‘a networking endpoint in an operating system’. A port in this context means a dedicated signal wire. By directing applications to a port you build a dedicated send/receive connection. This is particularly useful in getting two computers to talk to one another.For completeness there is a related concept called a socket which we do not need in this discussion.We proceed with a particularly important cloud-oriented use of ports. Suppose you have a cloud VM instance You wish to run some software that uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this case let’s consider thecommon example of a Jupyter notebook. Here a remote Jupyter notebook server is accustomed totalking to your machine via your local browser. The commands below follow this reference.Let’s assume you log in to the cloud VM at ip address 123.213.101.102 using ssh.There you issue% jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889This is directing the jupyter application to pay attention to port 8889.Next, on your local machine, say a laptop for example, you would issue:% ssh -N -f -i ~/.ssh/credential_filename.pem -L localhost:7005:localhost:8889 username@123.213.101.102This uses the ssh command. If you are using a Windows PC it is common to connect using PuTTY (see below).The point of the command is to create a tunnel from port 7005 on your local machine to port 8889 on the cloud VM.The -i switch specifies an identity file (key pair access to the cloud VM).The -L switch in the command stands for Local.  As another example concerning MySQL database connections: Here is a paraphrased quote from an online ssh tutorialhttp://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Linux:  SSH can forward communication across an SSH session that you establish.  For example, you can set up a port forward for your connection from your home machine to xyz.org such that connections to localhost port 3306 forward to the remote machine’s port 3306. Port 3306 is the port that the MySQL server listens on, so this would allow you to bypass the normal host checks that the MySQL server would make and allow you to run GUI MySQL programs on your local computer while using the database on your remote machine. Here is the command to accomplish this:  ssh -L 3306:mysql.xyz.org:3306 username@kilroy.xyz.org  The -L (which means Local port) takes one colon-delimeted argument.  local-host:local-port:connect-to-host:connect-to-port  You specify what host and port the connection will go to on the other side of the SSH connection.  When you make a connection to the local-host:local-port port it sends the data through the SSH connection to the connect-to-host:connect-to-port port. From the point of view of connect-to-host it is as if the connection came from that machine.In our example the ssh command for the Jupyter notebook connection stipulated port 7005 on localhost. Hence on your local machine you can now open a browser and enter in the address bar:localhost:7005If all is well you will see the Jupyter notebook (from the cloud VM) on your browser.Jupyter notebooks have associated passwords; and in the case above our colleague had to set this password to an empty string in the Jupyter config file due to Jupyter permission default settings.The main point here is that the ssh protocol can be used to create tunnels into cloud VMs and that this particularly applies when you want to see GUI content on your local machine.PuTTYThe Windows PC environment does not yet support the ssh command and consequently cloud VM connections typicallyuse the PuTTY application. (There are also alternative options ). PuTTY is a slightly circuitous but perfectly reliable means of connecting with a cloud VM, supporting as it does severalcommunication protocols including ssh.The main point here is that a VM credential file with a .pem extension does not work with PuTTY. You can use the companionapplication PuTTYgen to convert this file to an equivalent file with a .ppk file extension.  The PuTTY program can then use this credential file to connect to a cloud VM.kilroy need screencap of PuTTYgen in operation and the menu location for specifying a .ppk file.kilroy need text and screencap showing use of PuTTY to accomplish the Jupyter tunnel given above; and copy to the all Jupyter pages as well.Python connectionsPython has a Library to help simplify connecting to a URL. The following code is a simple program that demonstratesan API call to our AralDIF project:import urllib2import timedef dif(calltype, date1, date2, station):    baseAPI = 'https://araldif.azurewebsites.net/api/'    apiExtension = calltype + '?' + 'start=' + date1 + '&amp;' + 'end=' + date2 + '&amp;' + 'station=' + station + '&amp;'    api_call = baseAPI + apiExtension    print api_call    t1 = time.time()    u = urllib2.urlopen(api_call)    t2 = time.time()    data = u.read()    t3 = time.time()    print 'URL open required', t2 - t1, 'seconds; read() required', t3 - t2, 'seconds'    return datadata = dif('gethydrograph', '1995-01-01', '2000-12-31', 'UCHKU')print data[0:198]The output of this program (the first 198 characters returned) is as follows:https://araldif.azurewebsites.net/api/gethydrograph?start=1995-01-01&amp;end=2000-12-31&amp;station=UCHKU&amp;URL open required 9.09429216385 seconds; read() required 0.0734670162201 secondsDATE,FLOW1995-01-01,93.7872091995-01-02,90.7406311995-01-03,87.9480591995-01-04,85.2196811995-01-05,82.5006871995-01-06,79.9343341995-01-07,77.521661995-01-08,75.2189411995-01-09,73.028778Note that establishing the connection required about 9 seconds and the data transfer less than one tenth of a second.The importance of being able to write this code is high and can be understood as follows:If your research requires you to regularly go to an external data resource to make new data queries (updates, new ideas for looking at existing data and so on) then you traditionally carry this out by manual methods: Lots of clicking and dragging and waiting. The above Web Client demonstrates that this process can be automated; provided that the person maintaining the data service (in our example ‘araldif.azurewebsites.net’) has built and maintained their side of the automation contract.ExclamThis section describes using exclam in front of a Linux command from a Jupyter frame.Linux connectionsWarnings  ** Using curl requires a proper URL and – when hitting GitHub – this can be tricky to figure out.

"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this document – available here – is to introduce you to the public cloud as a research computing platform: Capable of powerful computation, secure,cost-effective, and potentially broadening your team’s capabilities.Links  The University of Washington has introductory material here.  True Cost of Ownership (TCO) is an important (kilroy: add spreadsheet info) factor and you can explore that specifically in the AWS framework here.  If you are interested in using Python to control your AWS computing environment: Look into the boto SDK  AWS EC2 instance descriptions and on-demand ratesWarningsThe information on this page could start you on an irrevocable course into cloud computing; massively reducingyour waiting time for intensive jobs to complete and enabling you to share your results with your colleagues andcolleagues you have never even met. Proceed at your own risk.OverviewThis essay presents cloud computing for research in its essentials, a ‘theoretical minimum’ that you should know if you are interested in doing research computing on the cloud. (Term borrowed from Leonard Susskind.) The cloud is a powerful flexible computing environment that can change and particularly streamline how you do computing. We present the argument for this here along with caveats and qualifiers. Our goal is to give you a realistic picture of what a cloud transition involves.The Case for CloudIf your computing environment meets your needs then migrating to the cloud could very well be unnecesary. However ifyou see room for improvement in your computing then the cloud is worth understanding. Here is a short list of some of the majoradvantages of cloud migration.      You pay for the compute power that you use.        You do not have to purchase, maintain, update, and re-purchase equipment        You have access to computing at tremendous scale; from one core to tens of thousands depending on your needs        You do not have to wait for cloud computing resources to become available        You can run your computing jobs to completion without interruption        You can purchase services such as a database without having to install and maintain them        You can easily build a web presence and use that to share data and information: With collaborators or with the public  The eScience InstituteThe eScience Institute is our originating organization at the University of Washington. They can help you withcomputing challenges beyond the cloud. For more please visit!SkillsIn order to successfully carry your computing to the cloud you and your team will need to learn a new set of skills. You will need to understand account management, security, cost estimation, and computing scale; all in relation to your work which we tend to assume depends on data-driven research computing. We recommend setting aside time for training (online or in person if possible) and setting aside more time for discussions on how to migrate to the cloud. If you and your group see the benefits and are anxious to get going the good news is that the cloud learning curve is not too bad; and is even pretty fun.VendorsThe public cloud came about as an excess of computing capacity at Amazon.  The company realized they could make available and monetize these compute resources; hence was born Amazon Web Services (AWS), the first large-scale public cloud. Other cloud vendors include Microsoft Azure and Google. We do not advocate any particular cloud vendor over the others. Each has its merits and we try and present some of those here at cloudmaven.org.CostHow much does the cloud cost? The fast answer is “3 cents per GB-month of storage and 3 cents for an hour of CPU time”. That is an answer we will qualify and expand on; but just to get you started…When you purchase a computer you are (apparently) done paying for it and you can use it until it fails; hopefully for 2 or more years. Then you need to purchase another computer. This is the traditional computing model and it makes sense if yourmachines are adequate to your computing needs provided that someone can pay for the electricity and cooling and someone has the time to maintain the operating system; and provided you have a good back-up strategy in case something bad happens. Cloud computing costs money but eliminates a lot of these ongoing maintenance tasks. Cloud computing resources are billed using a utility model: You pay for what you use.Cost is managed by turning off resources when they are not in use; and by carefully managing how many machines are in usewhen running jobs. Both of these tasks can be associated with automatic alarms that can prevent cloud usage from gettingout of control and expensive.See also the section below on cloud research credits, a way to mitigate the cost of learning if the cloud works for you.MachinesCloud computers typically run a version of Linux or a version of Windows. Furthermore you can choose from among dozens of machine types with varying amounts of memory and computing power. Cloud computers are accessed from (say) your laptop using various Client Applications, starting with ssh or PuTTY. As a rule you would develop your code locally, test it, and then deploy it to cloud machines where it runs.ClustersWhen you need compute power the cloud is a great resource. Cluster and Schedulers technologies are in place that enable youto grab hundreds to thousands of machines as needed, run your compute task to completion, and then just as quickly releasethose resources back into the general pool. Inter-node connection speed on the cloud is catching up to on-premise computecluster solutions via technologies like Infiniband.Development and TestingThe cloud is not necessarily a great place to write code.  Typically we write and test code locally and then test again on the cloudto verify that everything is working as expected, before going to large-scale processing tasks.A Success StoryTim Durham works in genomics at UW and has an analytical pipeline that operates on segments of the human genome; up to 3 billion base pairs. He is working to interpolate information linking human cell types to proteins.  Using the “server room at the end of the hall” Tim can complete small data subset processing runs in a matter of a week or two; in the process possibly restricting other researchers from using those machines. By taking the computing task to the public cloud (AWS and Azure) Tim is able to allocate many times more resources at once and finish a computation in a matter of hours. Hence three important cloud computing positives: No ‘shared resource’ restriction, no wait time to start processing, and faster processing for tasks that can be parallelized.When Tim completes a processing run he turns off the Linux machines he is using and thereby stops paying for them. This is the cloud utility cost model: You pay for what you use. The recovered output data are analyzed and his methods are refined. Once he feels that the configuration is optimized he’ll do a single large ‘scale up’ from 1% to the entire human genome. This task – built on Apache Spark – should run in a day and can be repeated in the future if the algorithm is further refined.Tim can – if he so chooses – make the results of this analysis publicly available through a cloud-hosted website. He could build this out on a Web Framework such as Django and build an API that provides public, programmatic access to the full results or to selected subsets. ‘Programmatic access’ means that other researchers can pull the results of interest into their workspace using a computer program rather than using a manual approach.Research Software DevelopmentSoftware repositories such as GitHub are enabling research collaborations to better manage software development. This is something of a developing art form (in research) with practices that can be quickly learned and readily implemented; and which will make software more robust, secure, and easier to build. It is highly likely that taking any steps to formalize software development within a research group will be beneficial, particularly as software typically has a half-life of a small number of years.In cloud computing software is often written on local computers – possibly tested there as well – and then migrated to cloud instances where the actual processing of data, modeling, etcetera takes place in earnest. The manner of development has a direct impact on security and is commensurately more important.SecurityThe cloud is extremely secure provided that the research group learns and follows appropriate guidelines. Both AWS and Microsoft have HIPAA-aligned technology called out in respective Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). The burden of compliance is placed on the research team; and UW IT is working to make this progress feasible and straightforward.AlarmsThe cloud is elastic – designed to expand to meet computing challenges – but this expansion is frequently automated. Since automation can do things in error, by accident, it is important to know how to cope with an undesirable growth condition using other means, i.e. means outside of the machinery that is causing the growth. This leads to the notion of Alarms. An alarm is how the cloud can be configured to catch circumstances in which resources grow out of control.Research CreditAWS and Microsoft Azure both have programs to grant cloud credits to approved research programs. The one-page application typically requires one to three months to process and can secure you in the neighborhood of $20,000 in cloud credits good for one year.Amazon cloud research credit pageAzure cloud research credit pageThe idea of these programs is to remove the cost risk of learning how to use the cloud. We anticipate that in the courseof a successful cloud adoption process you will learn to cost and budget for cloud computing after the grant is expired.Support contractsYou may very well want to pay a surcharge for technical support on your cloud account. You can pay for this using your research credits. It costs you $100 / month on AWS for “Business Level support” (or ten percent of your monthly budget if that is larger). You will be connected with skilled cloud professionals who will be able to help you overcome technical obstacles. You can also opt in toa support contract when you realize you need it.Services‘Services’ is a pretty general term; but here it means specifically things you This section describes a part of the cloud that you may not know about; but can learn: Services that are often dissociated from machines.Getting startedYour access to the cloud depends on you having a cloud account like an email account. Your account ID gets youaccess through a web browser to a cloud console where you allocate and manage resources. Suppose you have bothdata and code on your Windows PC. You want to get a powerful machine to run some analysis; here are the steps:      Log in to your cloud account        Allocate a Linux machine (for which you will pay an hourly rate, for example 47 cents per hour        Download the login credentials for that machine        Use WinSCP to copy your code and data to that rented cloud computer        Compile and run your code        Recover the results using WinSCP  There are many more details but this example covers the basic framework of getting something done on the cloud. To get started you will need an account. There are at least four approaches open to you:      Cloud novice approach: Get a $100 free credit account on AWS or a $200 free credit account on Microsoft Azure. Both require you to enter credit card info. This is like giving your hotel your credit card in case you break the TV.        You need some substantial compute power Today: Contact us by email. We may be able to quickly (within a few hours) set you up with a temporary User account. You will need to coordinate your usage with us; we will need to make sure you are ‘good to go’ managing resources; and we will ask that you do some reporting on your experience. This can be a short-term stop-gap if you’re stuck.        You need some serious compute power for a year at no cost (requires 2 months to set up): Fill out the one-page application here for AWS or the one-page application here for Microsoft Azure. On approval you can receive up to $20k in research credits for a year. Both public clouds are excellent so we do not recommend one over the other. Come visit our office hours if you would like to disucss relative merits further.        You need some serious compute power and you have a budget: Contact UW IT to set up a purchase order. This will take a couple of days.  We also wish to emphasize that other public clouds, particularly Google, have fantastic features as well. We are working to expand our representation of these other options.Abbreviated Glossary (See our more complete glossary as well.)

The project lead for this NASA-sponsored High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT) is Dr. Anthony Arendt, a UW Research Scientist.HiMAT data infrastructureA core feature of the HiMAT project is the construction and utilization of data sharing tools to foster efficient collaboration, reproducible research and enhanced stakeholder engagement. Our cloud-based data infrastructure aims to addresses several of the challenges that often limit effective collaboration in such projects:  cross-team collaboration necessitates the sharing of preliminary data products which are not yet fully validated and may not be ready to share with the public. Existing data infrastructures primarily store completed datasets on public-facing servers. So there is a considerable gap in our provisioning of privately accessible, cloud-based computational tools for this kind of research.  datasets to be generated by HiMAT are particularly voluminous, for example high resolution satellite imagery. Many existing data centers are not set up to handle data of this size, and even if they are, it is unreasonable to be downloading datasets this large to local machines. Therefore we need methods to co-locate our processing/analysis with the location at which the data are stored.  the development collaborative tools calls for some degree of customization in our computational infrastructure if we are to integrate our products and provide decision support to the region. Therefore investigators need to have full access to both front and backend computational components, without the need to submit requests to third party agencies.To address these challenges we are designing a multi-tiered approach to data handling:"

For example, if you get the github-pages gem, it will retrieve all of these other gems:github-pages-health-check = 1.1.0jekyll = 3.0.3jekyll-coffeescript = 1.0.1jekyll-feed = 0.4.0jekyll-gist = 1.4.0jekyll-github-metadata = 1.9.0jekyll-mentions = 1.1.2jekyll-paginate = 1.1.0jekyll-redirect-from = 0.10.0jekyll-sass-converter = 1.3.0jekyll-seo-tag = 1.3.2jekyll-sitemap = 0.10.0jekyll-textile-converter = 0.1.0jemoji = 0.6.2kramdown = 1.10.0liquid = 3.0.6mercenary ~&gt; 0.3rdiscount = 2.1.8redcarpet = 3.3.3RedCloth = 4.2.9rouge = 1.10.1terminal-table ~&gt; 1.See how Bundler retrieved version 3.0.3 of the jekyll gem, even though (as of this writing) the latest version of the jekyll gem is 3.1.2? That’s because github-pages is only compatible up to jekyll 3.0.3. Bundler handles all of this dependency and version compatibility for you.Trying to keep track of which gems and versions are appropriate for your project can be a nightmare. This is the problem Bundler solves. As explained on Bundler.io:  Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.  Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle install.GemfilesBundler looks in a project’s “Gemfile” (no file extension) to see which gems are required by the project. The Gemfile lists the source and then any gems, like this:source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem 'github-pages'gem 'jekyll'The source indicates the site where Bundler will retrieve the gems: https://rubygems.org.The gems it retrieves are listed separately on each line.Here no versions are specified. Sometimes gemfiles will specify the versions like this:gem 'kramdown', '1.0'This means Bundler should get version 1.0 of the kramdown gem.To specify a subset of versions, the Gemfile looks like this:gem 'jekyll', '~&gt; 2.3'The ~&gt; sign means greater than or equal to the last digit before the last period in the number.Here it will get any gem equal to 2.3 but less than 3.0.If it adds another digit, the scope is affected:gem `jekyll`, `~&gt;2.3.1'This means to get any gem equal to 2.3.1 but less than 2.4.If it looks like this:gem 'jekyll', '~&gt; 3.0', '&gt;= 3.0.3'This will get any Jekyll gem between versions 3.0 and up to 3.0.3.See this Stack Overflow post for more details.Gemfile.lockAfter Bundler retrieves and installs the gems, it makes a detailed list of all the gems and versions it has installed for your project. The snapshot of all gems + versions installed is stored in your Gemfile.lock file, which might look like this:GEM  remote: https://rubygems.org/  specs:    RedCloth (4.2.9)    activesupport (4.2.5.1)      i18n (~&gt; 0.7)      json (~&gt; 1.7, &gt;= 1.7.7)      minitest (~&gt; 5.1)      thread_safe (~&gt; 0.3, &gt;= 0.3.4)      tzinfo (~&gt; 1.1)    addressable (2.3.8)    coffee-script (2.4.1)      coffee-script-source      execjs    coffee-script-source (1.10.0)    colorator (0.1)    ethon (0.8.1)      ffi (&gt;= 1.3.0)    execjs (2.6.0)    faraday (0.9.2)      multipart-post (&gt;= 1.2, &lt; 3)    ffi (1.9.10)    gemoji (2.1.0)    github-pages (52)      RedCloth (= 4.2.9)      github-pages-health-check (= 1.0.1)      jekyll (= 3.0.3)      jekyll-coffeescript (= 1.0.1)      jekyll-feed (= 0.4.0)      jekyll-gist (= 1.4.0)      jekyll-mentions (= 1.0.1)      jekyll-paginate (= 1.1.0)      jekyll-redirect-from (= 0.9.1)      jekyll-sass-converter (= 1.3.0)      jekyll-seo-tag (= 1.3.1)      jekyll-sitemap (= 0.10.0)      jekyll-textile-converter (= 0.1.0)      jemoji (= 0.5.1)      kramdown (= 1.9.0)      liquid (= 3.0.6)      mercenary (~&gt; 0.3)      rdiscount (= 2.1.8)      redcarpet (= 3.3.3)      rouge (= 1.10.1)      terminal-table (~&gt; 1.4)    github-pages-health-check (1.0.1)      addressable (~&gt; 2.3)      net-dns (~&gt; 0.8)      octokit (~&gt; 4.0)      public_suffix (~&gt; 1.4)      typhoeus (~&gt; 0.7)    html-pipeline (2.3.0)      activesupport (&gt;= 2, &lt; 5)      nokogiri (&gt;= 1.4)    i18n (0.7.0)    jekyll (3.0.3)      colorator (~&gt; 0.1)      jekyll-sass-converter (~&gt; 1.0)      jekyll-watch (~&gt; 1.1)      kramdown (~&gt; 1.3)      liquid (~&gt; 3.0)      mercenary (~&gt; 0.3.3)      rouge (~&gt; 1.7)      safe_yaml (~&gt; 1.0)    jekyll-coffeescript (1.0.1)      coffee-script (~&gt; 2.2)    jekyll-feed (0.4.0)    jekyll-gist (1.4.0)      octokit (~&gt; 4.2)    jekyll-mentions (1.0.1)      html-pipeline (~&gt; 2.3)      jekyll (~&gt; 3.0)    jekyll-paginate (1.1.0)    jekyll-redirect-from (0.9.1)      jekyll (&gt;= 2.0)    jekyll-sass-converter (1.3.0)      sass (~&gt; 3.2)    jekyll-seo-tag (1.3.1)      jekyll (~&gt; 3.0)    jekyll-sitemap (0.10.0)    jekyll-textile-converter (0.1.0)      RedCloth (~&gt; 4.0)    jekyll-watch (1.3.1)      listen (~&gt; 3.0)    jemoji (0.5.1)      gemoji (~&gt; 2.0)      html-pipeline (~&gt; 2.2)      jekyll (&gt;= 2.0)    json (1.8.3)    kramdown (1.9.0)    liquid (3.0.6)    listen (3.0.6)      rb-fsevent (&gt;= 0.9.3)      rb-inotify (&gt;= 0.9.7)    mercenary (0.3.5)    mini_portile2 (2.0.0)    minitest (5.8.4)    multipart-post (2.0.0)    net-dns (0.8.0)    nokogiri (1.6.7.2)      mini_portile2 (~&gt; 2.0.0.rc2)    octokit (4.2.0)      sawyer (~&gt; 0.6.0, &gt;= 0.5.3)    public_suffix (1.5.3)    rb-fsevent (0.9.7)    rb-inotify (0.9.7)      ffi (&gt;= 0.5.0)    rdiscount (2.1.8)    redcarpet (3.3.3)    rouge (1.10.1)    safe_yaml (1.0.4)    sass (3.4.21)    sawyer (0.6.0)      addressable (~&gt; 2.3.5)      faraday (~&gt; 0.8, &lt; 0.10)    terminal-table (1.5.2)    thread_safe (0.3.5)    typhoeus (0.8.0)      ethon (&gt;= 0.8.0)    tzinfo (1.2.2)      thread_safe (~&gt; 0.1)PLATFORMS  rubyDEPENDENCIES  github-pages  jekyllBUNDLED WITH   1.11.2You can always delete the Gemlock file and run Bundle install again to get the latest versions.

"summary": "You can insert notes, tips, warnings, and important alerts in your content. These notes make use of Bootstrap styling and are available through data references such as site.data.alerts.note.",
"body": "About alertsAlerts are little warnings, info, or other messages that you have called out in special formatting. In order to use these alerts or callouts, reference the appropriate value stored in the alerts.yml file as described in the following sections.AlertsSimilar to [inserting images][mydoc_images]), you insert alerts through various includes that have been developed. These includes provide templates through which you pass parameters to easily populate the right HTML code.{% include note.html content=\"This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.\" %}Here’s the result: Note: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.With alerts, there’s just one include property:            Property      description                  content      The content for the alert.      If you need multiple paragraphs, enter &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; tags. This is because block level tags aren’t allowed here, as Kramdown is processing the content as Markdown despite the fact that the content is surrounded by HTML tags. Here’s an example with a break:{% include note.html content=\"This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Now I'm typing on a  new line.\" %}Here’s the result: Note: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.  Now I’m typing on a  new line.Types of alerts availableThere are four types of alerts you can leverage:  note.html  tip.html  warning.html  important.htmlThey function the same except they have a different color, icon, and alert word. You include the different types by selecting the include template you want. Here are samples of each alert: Note: This is my note. Tip: This is my tip. Warning: This is my warning. Important: This is my important info.These alerts leverage includes stored in the _include folder. The content option is a parameter that you pass to the include. In the include, the parameter is passed like this:&lt;div markdown=\"span\" class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; {{include.content}}&lt;/div&gt;The content in content=\"This is my note.\" gets inserted into the {{include.content}}} part of the template. You can follow this same pattern to build additional includes. See this Jekyll screencast on includes or this screencast for more information.CalloutsThere’s another type of callout available called callouts. This format is typically used for longer callout that spans more than one or two paragraphs, but really it’s just a stylistic preference whether to use an alert or callout.Here’s the syntax for a callout:{% include callout.html content=\"This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. \" type=\"primary\" %} Here’s the result:This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs.The available properties for callouts are as follows:            Property      description                  content      The content for the callout.              type      The style for the callout. Options are danger, default, primary, success, info, and warning.      The types just define the color of the left border. Each of these callout types get inserted as a class name in the callout template. These class names correspond with styles in Bootstrap. These classes are common Bootstrap class names whose style attributes differ depending on your Bootstrap theme and style definitions.Here’s an example of each different type of callout:This is my danger type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.This is my default type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.This is my primary type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.This is my success type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.This is my info type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.This is my warning type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter.Now that in contrast to alerts, callouts don’t include the alert word (note, tip, warning, or important). You have to manually include it inside content if you want it.To include paragraph breaks, use &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; inside the callout:{% include callout.html content=\"**Important information**: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why I'm using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. That's usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but it's allowed here.\" type=\"primary\" %} Here’s the result:Important information: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why I’m using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. That’s usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but it’s allowed here.Use Liquid variables inside parameters with includesSuppose you have a product name or some other property that you’re storing as a variable in your configuration file (_congfig.yml), and you want to use this variable in the content parameter for your alert or callout. You will get an error if you use Liquid syntax inside a include parameter. For example, this syntax will produce an error:{% include note.html content=\"The {{site.company}} is pleased to announce an upcoming release.\" %}The error will say something like this:Liquid Exception: Invalid syntax for include tag. File contains invalid characters or sequences: ... Valid syntax: {% include file.ext param='value' param2='value' %}To use variables in your include parameters, you must use the “variable parameter” approach. First you use a capture tag to capture some content. Then you reference this captured tag in your include. Here’s an example.In my site configuration file (_congfig.yml), I have a property called company_name.company_name: Your companyI want to use this variable in my note include.First, before the note I capture the content for my note’s include like this:{% capture company_note %}The {{site.company_name}} company is pleased to announce an upcoming release.{% endcapture %}Now reference the company_note in your include parameter like this:{% include note.html content=company_note}Here’s the result: Note: The cloudmaven is pleased to announce an upcoming release.Note the omission of quotation marks with variable parameters.Also note that instead of storing the variable in your site’s configuration file, you could also put the variable in your page’s frontmatter. Then instead of using {{site.company_name}} you would use {{page.company_name}}.Markdown inside of callouts and alertsYou can use Markdown inside of callouts and alerts, even though this content actually gets inserted inside of HTML in the include. This is one of the advantages of kramdown Markdown. The include template has an attribute of markdown=\"span\" that allows for the processor to parse Markdown inside of HTML.Validity checkingIf you have some of the syntax wrong with an alert or callout, you’ll see an error when Jekyll tries to build your site. The error may look like this:Liquid Exception: Invalid syntax for include tag: content=\"This is my **info** type callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. type=\"info\" Valid syntax: {% include file.ext param='value' param2='value' %} in mydoc/mydoc_alerts.md These errors are a good thing, because it lets you know there’s an error in your syntax. Without the errors, you may not realize that you coded something incorrectly until you see the lack of alert or callout styling in your output.In this case, the quotation marks aren’t set correctly. I forgot the closing quotation mark for the content parameter include.Blast a warning to users on every pageIf you want to blast a warning to users on every page, add the alert or callout to the _layouts/page.html page right below the frontmatter. Every page using the page layout (all, by defaut) will show this message."

"body": "How to build Jekyll sitesThe normal way to build the Jekyll site is through the build command:jekyll buildTo build the site and view it in a live server so that Jekyll rebuilds that site each time you make a change, use the serve command:jekyll serveBy default, the _config.yml in the root directory will be used, Jekyll will scan the current directory for files, and the folder _site will be used as the output. You can customize these build commands like this:jekyll serve --config configs/myspecialconfig.yml --destination ../doc_outputsHere the configs/myspecialconfig.yml file is used instead of _config.yml. The destination directory is ../doc_outputs, which would be one level up from your current directory.Shortcuts for the build argumentsIf you have a long build argument and don’t want to enter it every time in Jekyll, noting all your configuration details, you can create a shell script and then just run the script. Simply put the build argument into a text file and save it with the .sh extension (for Mac) or .bat extension (for Windows). Then run it like this:. myscript.shMy preference is to add the scripts to profiles in iTerm. See [iTerm Profiles][mydoc_iterm_profiles] for more details.Stop a serverWhen you’re done with the preview server, press Ctrl+C to exit out of it. If you exit iTerm or Terminal without shutting down the server, the next time you build your site, or if you build multiple sites with the same port, you may get a server-already-in-use message.You can kill the server process using these commands:ps aux | grep jekyllFind the PID (for example, it  looks like “22298”).Then type kill -9 22298 where “22298” is the PID.To kill all Jekyll instances, use this:kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')I recommend creating a profile in iTerm that stores this command. Here’s what the iTerm settings look like:iTerm profile settings to kill all Jekyll"

Configure the build scripts                                                About the build scriptsThe mydoc project has 5 build scripts and a script that runs them all. These scripts will require a bit of detail to configure. Every team member who is publishing on the project should set up their folder structure in the way described here.Get Set UpYour command-line terminal opens up to your user name (for example, Users/tjohnson). I like to put all of my projects from repositories into a subfolder under my username called “projects.” This makes it easy to get to the projects from the command line. You can vary from the project organization I describe here, but following the pattern I outline will make configuration easier.To set up your projects:  Set up your Jekyll theme in a folder called “docs.” All of the source files for every project the team is working on should live in this directory. Most likely you already either downloaded or cloned the jekyll-documentation-theme. Just rename the folder to “docs” and move it into the projects folder as shown here.      In the same root directory where the docs folder is, create another directory parallel to docs called doc_outputs.     Thus, your folder structure should be something like this:    projects- docs- doc_outputs        The docs folder contains the source of all your files, while the doc_outputs contains the site outputs.  Configure the Build ScriptsFor the mydocs project, you’ll see a series of build scripts for each project. There are 5 build scripts, described in the following sections. Note that you really only need to run the last one, e.g., mydoc_all.sh, because it runs all of the build scripts. But you have to make sure each script is correctly configured so that they all build successfully. Tip: In the descriptions of the build scripts, “mydoc” is used as the sample project. Substitute in whatever your real project name is.mydoc_1_multiserve_pdf.shHere’s what this script looks like:echo 'Killing all Jekyll instances'kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')clearecho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc Writers ...\"jekyll serve --detach --config configs/mydoc/config_writers.yml,configs/mydoc/config_writers_pdf.ymlecho \"done\"echo \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc Designers ...\"jekyll serve --detach --config configs/mydoc/config_designers.yml,configs/mydoc/config_designers_pdf.ymlecho \"done\"echo \"All done serving up the PDF-friendly sites. Now let's generate the PDF files from these sites.\"echo \"Now run . mydoc_2_multibuild_pdf.sh\"After killing all existing Jekyll instances that may be running, this script serves up a PDF friendly version of the docs (in HTML format) at the destination specified in the configuration file.Each of your configuration files needs to have a destination like this: ../doc_outputs/mydoc/adtruth-java. That is, the project should build in the doc_outputs folder, in a subfolder that matches the project name.The purpose of this script is to make a version of the HTML output that is friendly to the Prince XML PDF generator. This version of the output strips out the sidebar, topnav, and other components to just render a bare-bones HTML representation of the content.Customize the script with your own PDF configuration file names.mydoc_2_multibuild_pdf.shHere’s what this script looks like:# Doc Writersecho \"Building the Mydoc Writers PDF ...\"prince --javascript --input-list=../doc_outputs/mydoc/writers-pdf/prince-file-list.txt -o mydoc/files/mydoc_writers_pdf.pdf;echo \"done\"# Doc Designersecho \"Building Mydoc Designers PDF ...\"prince --javascript --input-list=../doc_outputs/mydoc/designers-pdf/prince-file-list.txt -o mydoc/files/mydoc_designers_pdf.pdf;echo \"done\"echo \"All done building the PDFs!\"echo \"Now build the web outputs: . mydoc_3_multibuild_web.sh\"This script builds the PDF output using the Prince command. The script reads the location of the prince-file-list.txt file in the PDF friendly output folder (as defined in the previous script) and builds a PDF.The Prince build command takes an input parameter (--input-list=) that lists where all the pages are (prince-file-list.txt), and then combines all the pages into a PDF, including cross-references and other details. The Prince build command also specifies the output folder (-o).The prince-file-list.txt file (which simply contains a list of URLs to HTML pages) is generated by iterating through the table of contents (mydoc_sidebar.yml) and creating a list of URLs. You can open up prince-file-list.txt in the doc output to ensure that it has a list of absolute URLs (not relative) in order for Prince to build the PDF.This is one way the configuration file for the PDF-friendly output differs from the HTML output. (If the PDF isn’t building, it’s because the prince-file-list.txt in the output is empty or it contains relative URLs.)The Prince build script puts the output PDF into the mydoc/mydoc/files directory. Now you can reference the PDF file in your HTML site. For example, on the homepage you can allow people to download a PDF of the content at files/adtruth_dotnet_pdf.pdf.mydoc_3_multibuild_web.shHere’s what this script looks like:kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')clearecho \"Building Mydoc Writers website...\"jekyll build --config configs/doc/config_writers.yml# jekyll serve --config configs/doc/config_writers.ymlecho \"done\"echo \"Building Mydoc Designers website...\"jekyll build --config configs/doc/config_designers.yml# jekyll serve --config configs/doc/config_designers.ymlecho \"done\"echo \"All finished building all the web outputs!!!\"echo \"Now push the builds to the server with . mydoc_4_publish.sh\"After killing all Jekyll instances, this script builds an HTML version of the projects and puts the output into the doc_outputs folder. This is the version of the content that users will mainly navigate. Since the sites are built with relative links, you can browse to the folder on your local machine, double-click the index.html file, and see the site.The # part below the jekyll build commands contains a serve command that is there for mere convenience in case you want to serve up just one site among many that you’re building. For example, if you don’t want to build everything — just one site — you might just use the serve command instead. (Anything after # in a YAML file comments out the content.)mydoc_4_publish.shHere’s what this script looks like:echo \"remove previous directory and any subdirectories without a warning prompt\"ssh yourusername@yourdomain.com 'rm -rf /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory'echo \"push new content into the remote directory\"scp -r -vrC ../mydoc_outputs/doc-writers yourusername@yourdomain:/var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectoryecho \"All done pushing doc outputs to the server\"This script assumes you’re publishing content onto a Linux server.Change yourusername to your own user name.This script first removes the project folder on /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory site and then transfers the content from doc_outputs over to the appropriate folder in /var/www/html/yourpublishingdirectory.Note that the delete part of the script (rm -rf) works really well. It annihilates a folder in a heartbeat and doesn’t give you any warning prompts, so make sure you have it set up correctly.Also, in case you haven’t set up the SSH publishing without a password, see [Getting around the password prompts in SCP][mydoc_no_password_prompts_scp]. Otherwise the script will stop and ping you to enter your password for each directory it transfers.(Optional) Push to repositoriesThis script isn’t included in the theme, but you might optionally decide to push the built sites into another github repository. For example, if you’re using Cloud Cannon to deploy your sites, you can have Cloud Cannon read files from a specific Github repository.Here’s what this script looks like:cd doc_outputs/mydoc/designersgit add --allgit commit -m \"publishing latest version of docs\"git pushecho \"All done pushing to Github\"echo \"Here's the link to download the guides...\"cd ../../docsThis final script simply makes a commit into a Github repo for one of your outputs.The doc_outputs/mydoc/designers contains the site output from mydoc, so when you push content from this folder into Github, you’re actually pushing the HTML site output into Github, not the mydoc source files.Your delivery team can also grab the site output from these repos. After downloading it, the person unzips the folder and sees the website folders inside.mydoc_all.shHere’s what this script looks like:. deviceinsight_1_multiserve_pdf.sh; . deviceinsight_2_multibuild_pdf.sh; . deviceinsight_3_multibuild_web.sh; . deviceinsight_4_publish.sh;This script simply runs the other scripts. To sequence the commands, you just separate them with semicolons. (If you added the optional script, be sure to include it here.)After you’ve configured all the scripts, you can run them all by running . mydoc_all.sh. You might want to run this script at lunchtime, since it may take about 10 to 20 minutes to completely build the scripts.

In this case, if I wanted to loop through all tooltips, I would use site.tooltips instead of site.pages or site.posts.See Collections in the Jekyll documentation for more information.How to use collectionsI haven’t found a huge use for collections in normal documentation. However, I did find a use for collections in generating a tooltip file that would be used for delivering tooltips to a user interface from text files in the documentation.

This approach will involve using Github to edit the files.There’s an Edit me button on each page on this theme. This button allows collaborators to edit the content on Github.Here’s the code for that button on the page.html layout:{% unless jekyll.environment == \"production\" %}    {% if site.github_editme_path %}    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/{{site.github_editme_path}}/{{page.folder}}{{page.url | append: \".md\"}}{% endif %}\" class=\"btn btn-default githubEditButton\" role=\"button\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-github fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Edit me&lt;/a&gt;This code is only active if you’re publishing in a development environment, which is the default.To activate the production environment, add the production environment flag in your build command:JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll serveIn your configuration file, edit the value for github_editme_path. For example, you might create a branch called “reviews” on your Github repo. Then you would add something like this in your configuration file for the ‘github_editme_path’: tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll/edit/reviews. Here “tomjohnson1492” is my github account name. The repo name is “documentation-theme-jekyll”. The “reviews” name is the branch.Add reviewers as collaboratorsIf you want people to collaborate on your project so that their edits get committed to a branch on your project, you need to add them as collaborators. For your Github repo, click Settings and add the collaborators on the Collaborators tab using their Github usernames.If you don’t want to allow anyone to commit to your Github branch, don’t add the reviewers as collaborators. When someone makes an edit, Github will fork the theme. The person’s edit then will appear as a pull request to your repo. You can then choose to merge the change indicated in the pull or not. Note: When you process pull requests, you have to accept everything or nothing. You can’t pick and choose which changes you’ll merge. Therefore you’ll probably want to edit the branch you’re planning to merge or ask the contributor to make some changes to the fork before processing the pull request.WorkflowUsers will make edits in your “reviews” branch (or whatever you want to call it). You can then commit those edits as you make updates.When you’re finished making all updates in the branch, you can merge the branch into the master.Note that if you’re making updates online, those updates will be out of sync with any local edits. Warning: Don’t make edits both online using Github’s browser-based interface AND offline on your local machine using your local tools. When you try to push from your local, you’ll likely get a merge conflict error. Instead, make sure you do a pull and update on your local after making any edits online.Prose.ioProse.io is an overlay on Github that would allow people to make comments in an easier interface. If you simply go to prose.io, it asks to authorize your Github account, and so it will read files directly from Github but in the Prose.io interface."

"url": "mydoc_conditional_logic.html",
"summary": "You can implement advanced conditional logic that includes if statements, or statements, unless, and more. This conditional logic facilitates single sourcing scenarios in which you're outputting the same content for different audiences.",
"body": "About Liquid and conditional statementsIf you want to create different outputs for different audiences, you can do all of this using a combination of Jekyll’s Liquid markup and values in your configuration file. This is how I previously configured the theme. I had different configuration files for each output. Each configuration file specified different values for product, audience, version, and so on. Then I had different build processes that would leverage the different configuration files. It seemed like a perfect implementation of DITA-like techniques with Jekyll.But I soon found that having lots of separate outputs for a project was undesirable. If you have 10 different outputs that have different nuances for different audiences, it’s hard to manage and maintain. In this latest version of the theme, I consolidated all information into the same output to explicitly do away with the multi-output approach.As such, the conditional logic won’t have as much play as it previously did. Instead of conditions, you’ll probably want to incorporate navtabs to split up the information.However, you can still of course use conditional logic as needed. Tip: Definitely check out Liquid’s documentation for more details about how to use operators and other liquid markup. The notes here are a small, somewhat superficial sample from the site.Where to store filtering valuesYou can filter content based on values that you have set either in your page’s frontmatter, a config file, or in a file in your _data folder. If you set the attribute in your config file, you need to restart the Jekyll server to see the changes. If you set the value in a file in your _data folder or page frontmatter, you don’t need to restart the server when you make changes.Conditional logic based on config file valueHere’s an example of conditional logic based on a value in the page’s frontmatter. Suppose you have the following in your frontmatter:platform: macOn a page in my site (it can be HTML or markdown), you can conditionalize content using the following:{% if page.platform == \"mac\" %}Here's some info about the Mac.{% elsif page.platform == \"windows\" %}Here's some info about Windows ...{% endif %}This uses simple if-elsif logic to determine what is shown (note the spelling of elsif). The else statement handles all other conditions not handled by the if statements.Here’s an example of if-else logic inside a list:To bake a casserole:1. Gather the ingredients.{% if page.audience == \"writer\" %}2. Add in a pound of meat.{% elsif page.audience == \"designer\" %}3. Add in an extra can of beans.{% endif %}3. Bake in oven for 45 min.You don’t need the elsif or else. You could just use an if (but be sure to close it with endif).Or operatorYou can use more advanced Liquid markup for conditional logic, such as an or command. See Shopify’s Liquid documentation for more details.For example, here’s an example using or:{% if page.audience contains \"vegan\" or page.audience == \"vegetarian\" %}    Then run this...{% endif %}Note that you have to specify the full condition each time. You can’t shorten the above logic to the following:{% if page.audience contains \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" %}    // run this.{% endif %}This won’t work.Unless operatorYou can also use unless in your logic, like this:{% unless site.output == \"pdf\" %}...do this{% endunless %}When figuring out this logic, read it like this: “Run the code here unless this condition is satisfied.”.”Don’t read it the other way around or you’ll get confused. (It’s not executing the code only if the condition is satisfied.)Storing conditions in the _data folderHere’s an example of using conditional logic based on a value in a data file:{% if site.data.options.output == \"alpha\" %}show this content...{% elsif site.data.options.output == \"beta\" %}show this content...{% else %}this shows if neither of the above two if conditions are met.{% endif %}To use this, I would need to have a _data folder called options where the output property is stored.Specifying the location for _dataYou can also specify a data_source for your data location in your configuration file. Then you aren’t limited to simply using _data to store your data files.For example, suppose you have 2 projects: alpha and beta. You might store all the data files for alpha inside data_alpha, and all the data files for beta inside data_beta.In your alpha configuration file, specify the data source like this:data_source: data_alphaThen create a folder called _data_alpha.For your beta configuration file, specify the data source like this:data_source: data_betaThen create a folder called _data_beta.Conditions versus includesIf you have a lot of conditions in your text, it can get confusing. As a best practice, whenever you insert an if condition, add the endif at the same time. This will reduce the chances of forgetting to close the if statement. Jekyll won’t build if there are problems with the liquid logic.If your text is getting busy with a lot of conditional statements, consider putting a lot of content into includes so that you can more easily see where the conditions begin and end."

You can’t specify that you only want a specific part of the file included. However, you can use parameters with includes. See the following Jekyll cast for more info about using parameters with includes:Page-level variablesYou can also create custom variables in your frontmatter like this:---title: Page-level variablespermalink: page_level_variables/thing1: Joething2: Dave---You can then access the values in those custom variables using the page namespace, like this:thing1: {{page.thing1}}thing2: {{page.thing2}}I use includes all the time.

"body": "About exclusionBy default, all files in your project are included in your output (regardless of whether they’re listed in the sidebar_doc.yml file or not). To exclude files, note them in the exclude section in the configuration file. Here’s a sample:exclude:  - mydoc_writers_*  - bower_components  - GemfileIf you have different outputs for your site, you’ll want to customize the exclude sections in your various configuration files.Exclude strategiesHere’s the process I recommend. Put all files in the root directory of your project. Suppose one project’s name is alpha and the other is beta. Then name each file as follows:  alpha_sample.html  beta_sample.htmlIn your exclude list for your beta project, specify it as follows:exclude:- alpha_*In your exclude list for your alpha project, specify it as follows:exclude:- beta_*If you have more sophisticated exclusion, add another level to your file names. For example, if you have different programming languages you want to filter by, add this:  alpha_java_sample.html  alpha_cpp_sample.htmlThen you exclude files for your Alpha C++ project as follows:exclude:- alpha_java_*- beta_*And you exclude files for your Alpha Java project as follows:exclude:- alpha_cpp_*- alpha_beta_*When you exclude folders, include the trailing slash at the end of the folder name:exclude:- images/alpha/There isn’t a way to automatically exclude anything. By default, everything is included unless you explicitly list it under the exclude section.Excluding draft contentIf you’re working on a draft, put it inside the _drafts folder or add published: false in the frontmatter. The _drafts folder is excluded by default, so you don’t have to specify it in your exclude list.LimitationsWhat if a file should appear in two projects but not the third? This can get tricky. For some files, rather than using a wildcard, you may need to manually specify the entire filename that you’re excluding instead of excluding it by way of a wildcard pattern."

"summary": "You can generate a PDF from your Jekyll project. You do this by creating a web version of your project that is printer friendly. You then use utility called Prince to iterate through the pages and create a PDF from them. It works quite well and gives you complete control to customize the PDF output through CSS, including page directives and dynamic tags from Prince.",
"body": "PDF overviewThis process for creating a PDF relies on Prince XML to transform the HTML content into PDF. Prince costs about $500 per license. That might seem like a lot, but if you’re creating a PDF, you’re probably working for a company that sells a product, so you likely have access to some resources.The basic approach is to generate a list of all pages that need to be added to the PDF, and then add leverage Prince to package them up into a PDF.It may seem like the setup is somewhat cumbersome, but it doesn’t take long. Once you set it up, building a pdf is just a matter of running a couple of commands.Also, creating a PDF this way gives you a lot more control and customization capabilities than with other methods for creating PDFs. If you know CSS, you can entirely customize the output.DemoYou can see an example of the finished product here: PDF Download1. Set up PrinceDownload and install Prince.You can install a fully functional trial version. The only difference is that the title page will have a small Prince PDF watermark.2. Create a new configuration file for each of your PDF targetsThe PDF configuration file will build on the settings in the regular configuration file but will some additional fields. Here’s the configuration file for the mydoc product within this theme. This configuration file is located in the pdfconfigs folder.destination: _site/url: \"http://127.0.0.1:4010\"baseurl: \"/mydoc-pdf\"port: 4010output: pdfproduct: mydocprint_title: Jekyll theme for documentation — mydoc productprint_subtitle: version 5.0output: pdfdefaults:  -    scope:      path: \"\"      type: \"pages\"    values:      layout: \"page_print\"      comments: true      search: true Note: Although you’re creating a PDF, you must still build an HTML web target before running Prince. Prince will pull from the HTML files and from the file-list for the TOC.Note that the default page layout specified by this configuration file is page_print. This layout strips out all the sections that shouldn’t appear in the print PDF, such as the sidebar and top navigation bar.Also note that there’s a output: pdf toggle in case you want to make some of your content unique to PDF output. For example, you could add conditional logic that checks whether site.output is pdf or web. If it’s pdf, then include information only for the PDF, and so on. If you’re using nav tabs, you’ll definitely want to create an alternative experience in the PDF.In the configuration file, customize the values for the print_title and print_subtitle that you want. These will appear on the title page of the PDF.3. Make sure your sidebar_doc.yml file has a titlepage.html and tocpage.htmlThere are two template pages in the root directory that are critical to the PDF:  titlepage.html  tocpage.htmlThese pages should appear in your sidebar YML file (in this product, mydoc_sidebar.yml):  - title:    output: pdf    type: frontmatter    folderitems:    - title:      url: /titlepage/      output: pdf      type: frontmatter    - title:      url: /tocpage/      output: pdf      type: frontmatterLeave these pages here in your sidebar. (The output: pdf property means they won’t appear in your online TOC because the conditional logic of the sidebar.html checks whether web is equal to pdf or not before including the item in the web version of the content.)The code in the tocpage.html is mostly identical to that of the sidebar.html page. This is essential for Prince to create the page numbers correctly with cross references.There’s another file (in the root directory of the theme) that is critical to the PDF generation process: prince-list.txt. This file simply iterates through the items in your sidebar and creates a list of links. Prince will consume the list of links from prince-list.txt and create a running PDF that contains all of the pages listed, with appropriate cross references and styling for them all. Note: If you have any files that you do not want to appear in the PDF, add output: web (rather than output: pdf) in the list of attributes in your sidebar. The prince-list.txt file that loops through the mydoc_sidebar.yml file to grab the URLs of each page that should appear in the PDF will skip over any items that do not list output: pdf in the item attributes. For example, you might not want your tag archives to appear in the PDF, but you probably will want to list them in the online help navigation.4. Customize your headers and footersOpen up the css/printstyles.css file and customize what you want for the headers and footers. At the very least, customize the email address (youremail@domain.com) that appears in the bottom left.Exactly how the print styling works here is pretty nifty. You don’t need to understand the rest of the content in this section unless you want to customize your PDFs to look different from what I’ve configured. But I’m adding this information here in case you want to understand how to customize the look and feel of the PDF output.This style creates a page reference for a link:a[href]::after {    content: \" (page \" target-counter(attr(href), page) \")\"}You don’t want cross references for any link that doesn’t reference another page, so this style specifies that the content after should be blank:a[href*=\"mailto\"]::after, a[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]::after, a[href].noCrossRef::after {    content: \"\";} Tip: If you have a link to a file download, or some other link that shouldn’t have a cross reference (such as link used in JavaScript for navtabs or collapsible sections, for example, add noCrossRef as a class to the link to avoid having it say “page 0” in the cross reference.This style specifies that after links to web resources, the URL should be inserted instead of the page number:a[href^=\"http:\"]::after, a[href^=\"https:\"]::after {    content: \" (\" attr(href) \")\";}This style sets the page margins:@page {    margin: 60pt 90pt 60pt 90pt;    font-family: sans-serif;    font-style:none;    color: gray;}To set a specific style property for a particular page, you have to name the page. This allows Prince to identify the page.First you add frontmatter to the page that specifies the type. For the titlepage.html, here’s the frontmatter:---type: title---For the tocpage, here’s the frontmatter:---type: frontmatter---For the index.html page, we have this type tag (among others):---type: first_page---The default_print.html layout will change the class of the body element based on the type value in the page’s frontmatter:&lt;body class=\"{% if page.type == \"title\"%}title{% elsif page.type == \"frontmatter\" %}frontmatter{% elsif page.type == \"first_page\" %}first_page{% endif %} print\"&gt;Now in the css/printstyles.css file, you can assign a page name based on a specific class:body.title { page: title }This means that for content inside of body class=\"title\", we can style this page in our stylesheet using @page title.Here’s how that title page is styled:@page title {    @top-left {        content: \" \";    }    @top-right {        content: \" \"    }    @bottom-right {        content: \" \";    }    @bottom-left {        content: \" \";    }}As you can see, we don’t have any header or footer content, because it’s the title page.For the tocpage.html, which has the type: frontmatter, this is specified in the stylesheet:body.frontmatter { page: frontmatter }body.frontmatter {counter-reset: page 1}@page frontmatter {    @top-left {        content: prince-script(guideName);    }    @top-right {        content: prince-script(datestamp);    }    @bottom-right {        content: counter(page, lower-roman);    }    @bottom-left {        content: \"youremail@domain.com\";   }}With counter(page, lower-roman), we reset the page count to 1 so that the title page doesn’t start the count. Then we also add some header and footer info. The page numbers start counting in lower-roman numerals.Finally, for the first page (which doesn’t have a specific name), we restart the counting to 1 again and this time use regular numbers.body.first_page {counter-reset: page 1}h1 { string-set: doctitle content() }@page {    @top-left {        content: string(doctitle);        font-size: 11px;        font-style: italic;    }    @top-right {        content: prince-script(datestamp);        font-size: 11px;    }    @bottom-right {        content: \"Page \" counter(page);        font-size: 11px;    }    @bottom-left {        content: prince-script(guideName);        font-size: 11px;    }}You’ll see some other items in there such as prince-script. This means we’re using JavaScript to run some functions to dynamically generate that content. These JavaScript functions are located in the _includes/head_print.html:&lt;script&gt;    Prince.addScriptFunc(\"datestamp\", function() {        return \"PDF last generated: July 13, 2017\";    });&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;    Prince.addScriptFunc(\"guideName\", function() {        return \" User Guide\";    });&lt;/script&gt;There are a couple of Prince functions that are default functions from Prince. This gets the heading title of the page:        content: string(doctitle);This gets the current page:        content: \"Page \" counter(page);Because the theme uses JavaScript in the CSS, you have to add the --javascript tag in the Prince command (detailed later on this page).5. Customize the PDF scriptDuplicate the pdf-mydocf.sh file in the root directory and customize it for your specific configuration files.echo 'Killing all Jekyll instances'kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')clearecho \"Building PDF-friendly HTML site for Mydoc ...\";jekyll serve --detach --config _config.yml,pdfconfigs/config_mydoc_pdf.yml;echo \"done\";echo \"Building the PDF ...\";prince --javascript --input-list=_site/pdfconfigs/prince-list.txt -o _pdf/mydoc.pdf;echo \"done\";Note that the first part kills all Jekyll instances. This way you won’t try to serve Jekyll at a port that is already occupied.The jekyll serve command serves up the HTML-friendly PDF configurations for our two projects. This web version is where Prince will go to get its content.The prince script issues a command to the Prince utility. JavaScript is enabled (--javascript), and we tell it exactly where to find the list of files (--input-list) — just point to the prince-list.txt file. Then we tell it where and what to output (-o).Make sure that the path to the prince-list.txt is correct. For the output directory, I like to output the PDF file into my project’s source (into the files folder). Then when I build the web output, the PDF is included and something I can refer to. Note: You might not want to include the PDF in your project files, since you’re likely committing the PDF to Github and as a result saving the changes from one PDF version to another with each save.6. Add conditions for your new builds in the sidebarconfigs.html fileIn the _includes/custom/sidebarconfigs.html file, there’s a section that looks like this:{% if site.product == \"mydoc\" %}{% assign sidebar_pdf = site.data.sidebars.mydoc_sidebar.entries %}{% endif %}{% if site.product == \"product1\" %}{% assign sidebar_pdf = site.data.sidebars.product1_sidebar.entries %}{% endif %}{% if site.product == \"product2\" %}{% assign sidebar_pdf = site.data.sidebars.product2_sidebar.entries %}{% endif %}Add your own condition here that points to your sidebar.What this does is allow the prince-list.txt and toc.html files to use a variable for the sidebar (called sidebar_pdf) when iterating through the sidebar. Otherwise, you would need to create a unique prince-list.txt and toc.html file for each separate PDF output you have.7. Add a download button for the PDFYou can add a download button for your PDF using some Bootstrap button code:&lt;a target=\"_blank\" class=\"noCrossRef\" href=\"/pdf/mydoc.pdf\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" aria-label=\"Left Align\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; PDF Download&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here’s what that looks like:&lt;a target=”_blank” class=”noCrossRef” href=pdf/mydoc.pdf”&gt; PDF Download&lt;/a&gt;JavaScript conflictsIf you have JavaScript on any of your pages, Prince will note errors in Terminal like this:error: TypeError: value is not an objectHowever, the PDF will still build.You need to conditionalize out any JavaScript from your PDF web output before building your PDFs. Make sure that the PDF configuration files have the output: pdf property.Then surround the JavaScript with conditional tags like this:{% unless site.output == \"pdf\" %}javascript content here ...{% endunless %}For more detail about using unless in conditional logic, see [Conditional logic][mydoc_conditional_logic]. What this code means is “run this code unless this value is the case.”Overriding Bootstrap Print StylesThe theme relies on Bootstrap’s CSS for styling. However, for print media, Bootstrap applies the following style:@media print{*,:after,:before{color:#000!important;text-shadow:none!important;background:0 0!important;-webkit-box-shadow:none!important;box-shadow:none!important}This is minified, but basically the * (asterisk) means select all, and applied the color #000 (black). As a result, the Bootstrap style strips out all color from the PDF (for Bootstrap elements).This is problematic for code snippets that have syntax highlighting. I decided to remove this de-coloring from the print output. I commented out the Bootstrap style:@media print{*,:after,:before{/*color:#000!important;*/text-shadow:none!important;/*background:0 0!important*/;-webkit-box-shadow:none!important;box-shadow:none!important}If you update Bootrap, make sure you make this edit. (Sorry, admittedly I couldn’t figure out how to simply overwrite the * selector with a later style.)I did, however, remove the color from the alerts and lighten the background shading for pre elements. The printstyles.css has this setting."

"summary": "You can loop through files and generate a JSON file that developers can consume like a help API. Developers can pull in values from the JSON into interface elements, styling them as popovers for user interface text, for example. The beauty of this method is that the UI text remains in the help system (or at least in a single JSON file delivered to the dev team) and isn't hard-coded into the UI.",
"body": "Full code demo of content APIYou can create a help API that developers can use to pull in content.For the full code demo, see the notes in the Tooltips file.In this demo, the popovers pull in and display content from the information in a tooltips.json file located in the same directory.Instead of placing the JSON source in the same directory, you could also host the JSON file on another site.Additionally, instead of tooltip popovers, you could also print content directly to the page. Basically, whatever you can stuff into a JSON file, developers can integrate it onto a page.Diagram overviewHere’s a diagram showing the basic idea of the help API:Is this really an API? Well, sort of. The help content is pushed out into a JSON file that other websites and applications can easily consume. The endpoints don’t deliver different data based on parameters added to a URL. But the overall concept is similar to an API: you have a client requesting resources from a server.Note that in this scenario, the help is openly accessible on the web. If you have a private system, it’s more complicated.To deliver help this way using Jekyll, follow the steps in each of the sections below.1. Create a “collection” for the help contentA collection is another content type that extends Jekyll beyond the use of pages and posts. Call the collection “tooltips.”Add the following information to your configuration file to declare your collection:collections:  tooltips:    output: falseIn your Jekyll project’s root directory, create a new folder called “_tooltips” and put every page that you want to be part of that tooltips collection inside that folder.In Jekyll, folders that begin with an underscore (“_”) aren’t included in the output. However, in the collection information that you add to your configuration file, if you change output to true, the tooltips folder will appear in the output, and each page inside tooltips will be generated. You most likely don’t want this for tooltips (you just want the JSON file), so make the output setting false.2. Create tooltip definitions in a YAML fileInside the _data folder, create a YAML file called something like definitions.yml. Add the definitions for each of your tooltips here like this:basketball: \"Basketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor.\"The definition of basketball is stored this data file so that you can re-use it in other parts of the help as well. You’ll likely want the definition to appear not only in the tooltip in the UI, but also in the regular documentation as well.3. Create pages in your collectionCreate pages inside your new tooltips collection (that is, inside the _tooltips folder). Each page needs to have a unique id in the frontmatter as well as a product. Then reference the definition you created in the definitions.yml file.Here’s an example:```liquid---id: basketballproduct: mydoc---{{site.data.definitions.basketball}}```You need to create a separate page for each tooltip you want to deliver.The product attribute is required in the frontmatter to distinguish the tooltips produced here from the tooltips for other products in the same _tooltips folder. When creating the JSON file, Jekyll will iterate through all the pages inside _tooltips, regardless of any subfolders included here.4. Create a JSON file that loops through your collection pagesNow it’s time to create a JSON file with Liquid code that iterates through our tooltip collection and grabs the information from each tooltip file.Inside your project’s pages directory (e.g., mydoc), add a file called “tooltips.json.” (You can use whatever name you want.) Add the following to your JSON file:---layout: nonesearch: exclude---{\"entries\":[{% for page in site.tooltips %}{% if page.product == \"mydoc\" %}{\"id\"    : \"{{ page.id }}\",\"body\": \"{{ page.content | strip_newlines | replace: '\\', '\\\\\\\\' | replace: '\"', '\\\\\"' }}\"} {% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}]}Change “mydoc” to the product name you used in each of the tooltip files. The template here will only include content in the JSON file if it meets the product attribute requirements. We need this if statement to prevent tooltips from other products from being included in the JSON file.This code will loop through all pages in the tooltips collection and insert the id and body into key-value pairs for the JSON code. Here’s an example of what that looks like after it’s processed by Jekyll in the site build:{  \"entries\": [    {      \"id\": \"baseball\",      \"body\": \"Baseball is considered America's pasttime sport, though that may be more of a historical term than a current one. There's a lot more excitement about football than baseball. A baseball game is somewhat of a snooze to watch, for the most part.\"    },    {      \"id\": \"basketball\",      \"body\": \"Basketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor.\"    },    {      \"id\": \"football\",      \"body\": \"No doubt the most fun sport to watch, football also manages to accrue the most injuries with the players. From concussions to blown knees, football players have short sport lives.\"    },    {      \"id\": \"soccer\",      \"body\": \"If there's one sport that dominates the world landscape, it's soccer. However, US soccer fans are few and far between. Apart from the popularity of soccer during the World Cup, most people don't even know the name of the professional soccer organization in their area.\"    }  ]}You can also view the same JSON file here: tooltips.json.You can add different fields depending on how you want the JSON to be structured. Here we just have to fields: id and body. And the JSON is looking just in the tooltips collection that we created. Tip: Check out Google’s style guide for JSON. These best practices can help you keep your JSON file valid.Note that you can create different JSON files that specialize in different content. For example, suppose you have some getting started information. You could put that into a different JSON file. Using the same structure, you might add an if tag that checks whether the page has frontmatter that says type: getting_started or something. Or you could put the content into separate collection entirely (different from tooltips).By chunking up your JSON files, you can provide a quicker lookup. (I’m not sure how big the JSON file can be before you experience any latency with the jQuery lookup.)5. Build your site and look for the JSON fileWhen you build your site, Jekyll will iterate through every page in your _tooltips folder and put the page id and body into this format. In the output, look for the JSON file in the tooltips.json file. You’ll see that Jekyll has populated it with content. This is because of the triple hyphen lines in the JSON file — this instructs Jekyll to process the file.6. Allow CORS access to your help if stored on a remote serverYou can simply deliver the JSON file to devs to add to the project. But if you have the option, it’s best to keep the JSON file stored in your own help system. Assuming you have the ability to update your content on the fly, this will give you completely control over the tooltips without being tied to a specific release window.When people make calls to your site from other domains, you must allow them access to get the content. To do this, you have to enable something called CORS (cross origin resource sharing) within the server where your help resides.In other words, people are going to be executing calls to reach into your site and grab your content. Just like the door on your house, you have to unlock it so people can get in. Enabling CORS is unlocking it.How you enable CORS depends on the type of server.If your server setup allows htaccess files to override general server permissions, create an .htaccess file and add the following:Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\"Store this in the same directory as your project. This is what I’ve done in a directory on my web host (bluehost.com). Inside http://idratherassets.com/wp-content/apidemos/, I uploaded a file called “.htaccess” with the preceding code.After I uploaded it, I renamed it to .htaccess, right-clicked the file and set the permissions to 774.To test whether your server permissions are set correctly, open a terminal and run the following curl command pointing to your tooltips.json file:curl -I http://idratherassets.com/wp-content/apidemos/tooltips.jsonThe -I command tells cURL to return the request header only.If the server permissions are set correctly, you should see the following line somewhere in the response:Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *If you don’t see this response, CORS isn’t allowed for the file.If you have an AWS S3 bucket, you can supposedly add a CORS configuration to the bucket permissions. Log into AWS S3 and click your bucket. On the right, in the Permissions section, click Add CORS Configuration. In that space, add the following policy:&lt;CORSConfiguration&gt; &lt;CORSRule&gt;   &lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;*&lt;/AllowedOrigin&gt;   &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;GET&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt; &lt;/CORSRule&gt;&lt;/CORSConfiguration&gt;(Although this should work, in my experiment it doesn’t. And I’m not sure why…)In other server setups, you may need to edit one of your Apache configuration files. See Enable CORS or search online for ways to allow CORS for your server.If you don’t have CORS enabled, users will see a CORS error/warning message in the console of the page making the request. Tip: If enabling CORS is problematic, you could always just send developers the tooltips.json file and ask them to place it on their own server.7. Explain how developers can access the helpDevelopers can access the help using the .get method from jQuery, among other methods. Here’s an example of how to get a page with the ID of basketball:&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;$(document).ready(function(){var url = \"mydoc_tooltips_source.json\";$.get( url, function( data ) {        $.each(data.entries, function(i, page) {            if (page.id == \"basketball\") {            $( \"#basketball\" ).attr( \"data-content\", page.body );            }        });    });});&lt;/script&gt;View the tooltip demo for a demonstration.The url in the demo is relative, but you could equally point it to an absolute path on a remote host assuming CORS is enabled on the host.The each method looks through all the JSON content to find the item whose page.id is equal to basketball. It then looks for an element on the page named #basketball and adds a data-content attribute to that element. Warning: Make sure your JSON file is valid. Otherwise, this method won’t work. I use the JSON Formatter extension for Chrome. When I go to the tooltips.json page in my browser, the JSON content — if valid — is nicely formatted (and includes some color coding). If the file isn’t valid, it’s not formatted and there isn’t any color. You can also check the JSON formatting using JSON Formatter and Validator. If your JSON file isn’t valid, identify the problem area using the validator and troubleshoot the file causing issues. It’s usually due to some code that isn’t escaping correctly.Why data-content? Well, in this case, I’m using Bootstrap popovers to display the tooltip content. The data-content attribute is how Bootstrap injects popovers.Here’s the section on the page where the popover is inserted:&lt;p&gt;Basketball &lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign\" id=\"basketball\" data-toggle=\"popover\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Notice that I just have id=\"basketball\" added to this popover element. Developers merely need to add a unique ID to each tooltip they want to pull in the help content. Either you tell developers the unique ID they should add, or ask them what IDs they added (or just tell them to use an ID that matches the field’s name).In order to use jQuery and Bootstrap, you’ll need to add the appropriate references in the head tags of your page:&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;$(document).ready(function(){    $('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]').popover({        placement : 'right',        trigger: 'hover',        html: true    });Again, see the Tooltip Demo for a demo of the full code.Note that even though you reference a Bootstrap JS script, Bootstrap’s popovers require you to initialize them using the above code as well — they aren’t turned on by default.View the source code of the tooltip demo for the full comments.8. Create easy links to embed the help in your help siteYou might also want to insert the same content into different parts of your help site. For example, if you have tooltips providing definitions for fields, you’ll probably want to create a page in your help that lists those same definitions.You could use the same method developers use to pull help content into their applications. But it will probably be easier to simply use Jekyll’s tags for doing it.Here’s how you would reuse the content:&lt;h2&gt;Reuse Demo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Sport&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Comments&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Basketball&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.basketball}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Baseball&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.baseball}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Football&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.football}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Soccer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{site.data.definitions.soccer}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;And here’s the code:Reuse DemoSportCommentsBasketballBasketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground.

It’s much easier to use Automated links, as described in the next section.Automated linksThis method for automated links creates a master list of all links in a Markdown reference format based on entries in your sidebar table of contents.With this Automated links method, make sure all your pages are referenced in a sidebar or topnav data file (inside _data &gt; sidebars). If they’re not in a sidebar or top nav (such as links to headings on a page), list them in the other.yml file (which is in the _data/sidebars folder).The links.html file (in _includes) will iterate through all your sidebars and create a list of reference-style markdown links based on the url properties in the sidebar items. Note: For the automated links method to work, each of your pages must have a permalink property in the frontmatter. The permalink property must match the file name. For example, if the file name is somefile.html, your permalink property would be somefile.html. See [Pages][mydoc_pages] for more details.To implement managed links:      In your _config.yml file, list each sidebar in the sidebars property — including the other.yml file too:    sidebars:- home_sidebar- mydoc_sidebar- product1_sidebar- product2_sidebar- other            At the bottom of each topic where you plan to include links, include the links.html file:    {% include links.html %}            To link to a topic, use reference-style Markdown links, with the referent using the file name (without the file extension). For example:    See the [Icon][mydoc_icons] file.        Here’s the result:    See the [Icon][mydoc_icons] file.    If the link doesn’t render, check to make sure the page is correctly listed in the sidebar.  Automated links to headings on pagesIf you’re linking to the specific heading from another page, first give the heading an ID:## Some heading {#someheading}Then add a property into the other.yml file in your _data/sidebars folder:    - title: Some link bookmark      url: /mydoc_pages.html#someIdTagAnd reference it like this:This is [Some link][mydoc_pages.html#someIdTag].Result:This is Some link.It’s a little strange having the .html# in a reference like this, but it works."

"body": "Font icon optionsThe theme has two font icon sets integrated: Font Awesome and Glyphicons Halflings. The latter is part of Bootstrap, while the former is independent. Font icons allow you to insert icons drawn as vectors from a CDN (so you don’t have any local images on your own site).See Font Awesome icons availableGo to the Font Awesome library to see the available icons.The Font Awesome icons allow you to adjust their size by simply adding fa-2x, fa-3x and so forth as a class to the icon to adjust their size to two times or three times the original size. As vector icons, they scale crisply at any size.Here’s an example of how to scale up a camera icon:&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; normal size (1x)&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-lg&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-2x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-2x&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-3x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-3x&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-4x&lt;i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-5x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-5xHere’s what they render to: 1x fa-lg fa-2x fa-3x fa-4x fa-5xWith Font Awesome, you always use the i tag with the appropriate class. You also implement fa as a base class first. You can use font awesome icons inside other elements. Here I’m using a Font Awesome class inside a Bootstrap alert:&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;This is a special warning message.Here’s the result: This is a special warning message.The notes, tips, warnings, etc., are pre-coded with Font Awesome and stored in the alerts.yml file. That file includes the following:tip: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;'note: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;'important: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-warning\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;'warning: '&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;'end: '&lt;/div&gt;'callout_danger: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-danger\"&gt;'callout_default: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-default\"&gt;'callout_primary: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-primary\"&gt;'callout_success: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"&gt;'callout_info: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"&gt;'callout_warning: '&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-warning\"&gt;'hr_faded: '&lt;hr class=\"faded\"/&gt;'hr_shaded: '&lt;hr class=\"shaded\"/&gt;'This means you can insert a tip, note, warning, or important alert simply by using these tags.{% include note.html content=\"Add your note here.\" %}{% include tip.html content=\"Add your tip here.\" %}{% include important.html content=\"Add your important info here.\" %}{% include warning.html content=\"Add your warning here.\" %}Here’s the result: Note: Add your note here. Tip: Here’s my tip. Important: This information is very important. Warning: If you overlook this, you may die.The color scheme is the default colors from Bootstrap. You can modify the icons or colors as needed.Creating your own combinationsYou can innovate with your own combinations. Here’s a similar approach with a file download icon:&lt;div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-download fa-lg\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; This is a special tip about some file to download....&lt;/div&gt;And the result: This is a special tip about some file to download....Grab the right class name from the Font Awesome library and then implement it by following the pattern shown previously.If you want to make your fonts even larger than the 5x style, add a custom style to your stylesheet like this:.fa-10x{font-size:1700%;}Then any element with the attribute fa-10x will be enlarged 1700%.Glyphicon icons availableGlyphicons work similarly to Font Awesome. Go to the Glyphicons library to see the icons available.Although the Glyphicon Halflings library doesn’t provide the scalable classes like Font Awesome, there’s a StackOverflow trick  to make the icons behave in a similar way. This theme’s stylesheet (customstyles.css) includes the following to the stylesheet:.gi-2x{font-size: 2em;}.gi-3x{font-size: 3em;}.gi-4x{font-size: 4em;}.gi-5x{font-size: 5em;}Now you just add gi-5x or whatever to change the size of the font icon:&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-globe gi-5x\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And here’s the result:Glypicons use the span element instead of i to attach their classes.Here’s another example:&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And magnified:&lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download gi-3x\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You can also put glyphicons inside other elements:&lt;div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\"&gt;  &lt;span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Error:&lt;/b&gt; Enter a valid email address&lt;/div&gt;    Error: Enter a valid email addressCalloutsThe previously shown alerts might be fine for short messages, but with longer notes, the solid color takes up a bit of space. In this theme, you also have the option of using callouts, which are pretty common in Bootstrap’s documentation but surprisingly not offered as an explicit element. Their styles have been copied into this theme, in a way similar to the alerts:&lt;div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"&gt; This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message. This is a special info message.

In Illustrator, when you do a Save As with your AI file and choose SVG, to preserve your fonts, in the Font section, select “Convert to outline” as the Type (don’t choose SVG in the Font section).Also, remove the check box for “Use textpath element for text on a path”. And select “Embed” rather than “Link.” The following screenshot shows the settings I use. Your graphics will look great in Firefox.Essential options for SVG with Illustrator"

"summary": "Installation of Jekyll on Mac is usually less problematic than on Windows. However, you may run into permissions issues with Ruby that you must overcome. You should also use Bundler to be sure that you have all the required gems and other utilities on your computer to make the project run.",
"body": "Ruby and RubyGemsRuby and RubyGems are usually installed by default on Macs. Open your Terminal and type which ruby and  which gem to confirm that you have Ruby and Rubygems. You should get a response indicating the location of Ruby and Rubygems.If you get responses that look like this:/usr/local/bin/rubyand/usr/local/bin/gemGreat! Skip down to the Bundler section.However, if your location is something like /Users/MacBookPro/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/gem, which points to your system location of Rubygems, you will likely run into permissions errors when trying to get a gem. A sample permissions error (triggered when you try to install the jekyll gem such as gem install jekyll) might look like this for Rubygems: &gt;ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)  You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.Instead of changing the write permissions on your operating system’s version of Ruby and Rubygems (which could pose security issues), you can install another instance of Ruby (one that is writable) to get around this.Install HomebrewHomebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and you can use it to install an alternative instance of Ruby code. To install Homebrew, run this command:/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"If you already had Homebrew installed on your computer, be sure to update it:brew updateInstall Ruby through HomebrewNow use Homebrew to install Ruby:brew install rubyLog out of terminal, and then then log back in.When you type which ruby and which gem, you should get responses like this:/usr/local/bin/rubyAnd this:/usr/local/bin/gemNow Ruby and Rubygems are installed under your username, so these directories are writeable.Note that if you don’t see these paths, try restarting your computer or try installing rbenv, which is a Ruby version management tool. If you still have issues getting a writeable version of Ruby, you need to resolve them before installing Bundler.Install the Jekyll gemAt this point you should have a writeable version of Ruby and Rubygem on your machine.Now use gem to install Jekyll:gem install jekyllYou can now use Jekyll to create new Jekyll sites following the quick-start instructions on Jekyllrb.com.Installing dependencies through BundlerSome Jekyll themes will require certain Ruby gem dependencies. These dependencies are stored in something called a Gemfile, which is packaged with the Jekyll theme. You can install these dependencies through Bundler. (Although you don’t need to install Bundler for this Documentation theme, it’s a good idea to do so.)Bundler is a package manager for RubyGems. You can use it to get all the gems (or Ruby plugins) that you need for your Jekyll project.You install Bundler by using the gem command with RubyGems:gem install bundlerIf you’re prompted to switch to superuser mode (sudo) to get the correct permissions to install Bundler in that directory, avoid doing this. All other applications that need to use Bundler will likely not have the needed permissions to run.Bundler goes out and retreives all the gems that are specified in a Jekyll project’s Gemfile. If you have a gem that depends on other gems to work, Bundler will go out and retrieve all of the dependencies as well. (To learn more about Bundler, see [About Ruby Gems][mydoc_about_ruby_gems_etc].The vanilla Jekyll site you create through jekyll new my-awesome-site doesn’t have a Gemfile, but many other themes (including the Documentation theme for Jekyll) do have a Gemfile.Serve the Jekyll Documentation theme  Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Documentation theme for Jekyll.

Git Bash gives you Linux-like control on Windows.Install RubyFirst you must install Ruby because Jekyll is a Ruby-based program and needs Ruby to run.  Go to RubyInstaller for Windows.  Under RubyInstallers, download and install one of the Ruby installers (usually one of the first two options).  Double-click the downloaded file and proceed through the wizard to install it.Install Ruby Development KitSome extensions Jekyll uses require you to natively build the code using the Ruby Development Kit.  Go to RubyInstaller for Windows.  Under the Development Kit section near the bottom, download one of the For use with Ruby 2.0 and above… options (either the 32-bit or 64-bit version).  Move your downloaded file onto your C drive in a folder called something like RubyDevKit.  Extract the compressed folder’s contents into the folder.      Browse to the RubyDevKit location on your C drive using your Command Line Prompt.    To see the contents of your current directory, type dir. To move into a directory, type cd foldername, where “foldername” is the name of the folder you want to enter. To move up a directory, type cd ../ one or more times depending on how many levels you want to move up. To move into your user’s directory, type /users. The / at the beginning of the path automatically starts you at the root.    Type ruby dk.rb init  Type ruby dk.rb installIf you get stuck, see the official instructions for installing Ruby Dev Kit.Install the Jekyll gemAt this point you should have Ruby and Rubygem on your machine.Now use gem to install Jekyll:gem install jekyllYou can now use Jekyll to create new Jekyll sites following the quick-start instructions on Jekyllrb.com.Installing dependencies through BundlerSome Jekyll themes will require certain Ruby gem dependencies.

Open the Gemfile in a text editor.    Typically you can open files from the Command Prompt by just typing the filename, but because Gemfile doesn’t have a file extension, no program will automatically open it. You may need to use your File Explorer and browse to the directory, and then open the Gemfile in a text editor such as Notepad.        Remove the existing contents. Then paste in the following:    source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem 'wdm'gem 'jekyll'        The wdm gem allows for the polling of the directory and rebuilding of the Jekyll site when you make changes. This gem is needed for Windows users, not Mac users.    Save and close the file.      Type bundle install.    Bundle retrieves all the needed gems and gem dependencies and downloads them to your computer. At this time, Bundle also takes a snapshot of all the gems used in your project and creates a Gemfile.lock file to store this information.  Git Clients for WindowsAlthough you can use the default command prompt with Windows, it’s recommended that you use Git Bash instead. The Git Bash client will allow you to run shell scripts and execute other Unix commands.Serve the Jekyll Documentation theme  Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Documentation theme for Jekyll.  Type jekyll serve      Go to the preview address in the browser. (Make sure you include the / at the end.)

There’s a lot of information about how to do a variety of things here, and it’s not all unique to this theme. But by and large, understanding how to do things in Jekyll depends on how your theme is coded. As a result, these additional details are provided.The instructions here are geared towards technical writers working on documentation. You may have a team of one or more technical writers working on documentation for multiple projects. You can use this same theme to author all of your documentation for each of your products. The theme is built to accommodate documentation for multiple products on the same site.Survey of featuresSome of the more prominent features of this theme include the following:  Bootstrap framework  Navgoco multi-level sidebar for table of contents  Ability to specify different sidebars for different products  Top navigation bar with drop-down menus  Notes, tips, and warning information notes  Tags for alternative navigation  Advanced landing page layouts from the Modern Business theme.Getting startedTo get started, see [Getting Started][index]."

Key Principle to Remember with ListsThe key principle is to line up the first character after the dot following the number:Lining up the left edge ensures the list stays in tact.For the sake of simplicity, use two spaces after the dot for numbers 1 through 9. Use one space for numbers 10 and up. If any part of your list doesn’t align symmetrically on this left edge, the list will not render correctly. Also note that this is characteristic of kramdown-flavored Markdown and may not yield the same results in other Markdown flavors."

Make sure you aren’t trying to float any element to the right of your navtabs, or there will be some awkward space in your layout.Appearance in the mini-TOCIf you put a heading in the navtab content, that heading will appear in the mini-TOC as long as the heading tag has an ID. If you don’t want the headings for each navtab section to appear in the mini-TOC, omit the ID attribute from the heading tag. Without this ID attribute in the heading, the mini-TOC won’t insert the heading title into the mini-TOC.Must use HTMLYou must use HTML within the navtab content because each navtab section is surrounded with HTML, and you can’t use Markdown inside of HTML.Match up ID tagsEach tab’s href attribute must match the id attribute of the tab content’s div section. So if your tab has href=\"#acme\", then you add acme as the ID attribute in &lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"acme\"&gt;.Set an active tabOne of the tabs needs to be set as active, depending on what tab you want to be open by default (usually the first one).&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"acme\"&gt;Sets a cookieThe navtabs are part of Bootstrap, but this theme sets a cookie to remember the last tab’s state. The js/customscripts.js file has a long chunk of JavaScript that sets the cookie. The JavaScript comes from this StackOverflow thread.By setting a cookie, if the user refreshes the page, the active tab is the tab the user last selected (rather than defaulting to the default active tab).Functionality to implementOne piece of functionality I’d like to implement is the ability to set site-wide nav tab options. For example, if the user always chooses PHP instead of Java in the code samples, it would be great to set this option site-wide by default. However, this functionality isn’t yet coded."

Vivamus sit amet hendrerit metus.CodeHere’s the code for the above (with the filler text abbreviated):&lt;ul id=\"profileTabs\" class=\"nav nav-tabs\"&gt;    &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#profile\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#about\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#match\" data-toggle=\"tab\"&gt;Match&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;div class=\"tab-content\"&gt;&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"profile\"&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Profile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praesent sit amet fermentum leo....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"about\"&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"match\"&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Match&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Vel vehicula ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Design constraintsBootstrap automatically clears any floats after the navtab. Make sure you aren’t trying to float any element to the right of your navtabs, or there will be some awkward space in your layout.Appearance in the mini-TOCIf you put a heading in the navtab content, that heading will appear in the mini-TOC as long as the heading tag has an ID. If you don’t want the headings for each navtab section to appear in the mini-TOC, omit the ID attribute from the heading tag. Without this ID attribute in the heading, the mini-TOC won’t insert the heading title into the mini-TOC.Must use HTMLYou must use HTML within the navtab content because each navtab section is surrounded with HTML, and you can’t use Markdown inside of HTML.Match up ID tagsEach tab’s href attribute must match the id attribute of the tab content’s div section. So if your tab has href=\"#acme\", then you add acme as the ID attribute in &lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"acme\"&gt;.Set an active tabOne of the tabs needs to be set as active, depending on what tab you want to be open by default (usually the first one).&lt;div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"acme\"&gt;Sets a cookieThe navtabs are part of Bootstrap, but this theme sets a cookie to remember the last tab’s state. The js/customscripts.js file has a long chunk of JavaScript that sets the cookie. The JavaScript comes from this StackOverflow thread.By setting a cookie, if the user refreshes the page, the active tab is the tab the user last selected (rather than defaulting to the default active tab).Functionality to implementOne piece of functionality I’d like to implement is the ability to set site-wide nav tab options. For example, if the user always chooses PHP instead of Java in the code samples, it would be great to set this option site-wide by default. However, this functionality isn’t yet coded."

"summary": "You can publish your docs via SSH through a Terminal window or more likely, via a shell script that you simply execute as part of the publishing process. However, you will be prompted for your password with each file transfer unless you configure passwordless SSH. The basic process for setting up password less SSH is to create a key on your own machine that you also transfer to the remote machine. When you use the SCP command, the remote machine checks that you have the authorized key and allows access without a password prompt.",
"body": "Get rid of password promptsTo remove the password prompts when connecting to servers via SSH:      On your local machine, go to your .ssh directory:    cd ~/.ssh        Note that any directory that starts with a dot, like .ssh, is hidden. You can view hidden folders by enabling them on your Mac. See this help topic. Additionally, when you look at the files in a directory, use ls -a instead of just ls to view the hidden files.    If you don’t have an .ssh directory, create one with mkdir .ssh.        Create a new key inside your .ssh directory:    ssh-keygen -t rsa            Press Enter. When prompted about “Enter file in which to save the key …”, press Enter again.    This will create a file called id_rsa.pub (the key) and id_rsa (your identification) in this .ssh folder.    When prompted for a passphrase for the key, just leave it empty and press Enter twice. You should see something like this:    tjohnson-mbpr13:.ssh tjohnson$ ssh-keygen -t rsaGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):Enter same passphrase again:Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.The key fingerprint is:9a:8f:b5:495:39:78:t5:dc:19:d6:29:66:02:e8:02:a0 yourname@yourname-mbpr99.local        The key’s randomart image is:    +--[ RSA 2048]----+|.                ||+                ||E                ||o.   .           ||.. = o S        ||.&amp;^  + 7i = o       ||      = B .      ||     o O +       ||      *.o        |+-----------------+        As you can see, RSA draws a picture for you. Take a screenshot of the picture, print it out, and put it up on your fridge.        Open up another terminal window (in iTerm, open another tab), and SSH in to your remote server:    ssh &lt;your_username&gt;@remoteserver.com            Change &lt;your_username&gt; to your actual username, such as tjohnson.    When you connect, you’ll be prompted for your password.    When you connect, by default you are routed to the personal folder on the directory. For example, /home/remoteserver/&lt;your_username&gt;. To see this directory, type pwd (or dir on Windows).        Create a new directory called .ssh on remoteserver.com server inside the /home/remoteserver/&lt;your_username&gt; directory.      mkdir -p .ssh        You can ensure that it’s there with this command:    ls -a        Without the -a, the hidden directory won’t be shown.        Open another Terminal window and browse to /Users//.ssh on your local machine.    cd ~/.ssh            Copy the id_rsa.pub from the /.ssh directory on your local machine to the /home/remoteserver//.ssh directory on the remoteserver server:    scp id_rsa.pub &lt;your-username&gt;@yourserver.com:/home/remoteserver/&lt;your-username&gt;/.ssh            Switch back into your terminal window that is connected to remoteserver.com, change directory to the .ssh directory, and rename the file from id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys (without any file extension):    mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys            Change the file permissions to 700:    chmod 700 authorized_keys        Now you should be able to SSH onto remoteserver without any password prompts.        Open another terminal (which is not already SSH’d into remoteserver.com) and try the following:    ssh &lt;your_username&gt;@remoteserver.com        If successful, you shouldn’t be prompted for a password.    Now that you can connect without password prompts, you can use the scp scripts to transfer files to the server without  password prompts.

"url": "mydoc_pages.html",
"summary": "This theme primarily uses pages. You need to make sure your pages have the appropriate frontmatter. One frontmatter tag your users might find helpful is the summary tag. This functions similar in purpose to the shortdesc element in DITA.",
"body": "Where to author contentUse a text editor such as Sublime Text, WebStorm, IntelliJ, or Atom to create pages. Atom is recommended because it’s created by Github, which is driving some of the Jekyll development through Github Pages.Where to save pagesYou can store your pages in any folder structures you want, with any level of folder nesting. The site output will pull all of those pages out of their folders and put them into the root directory. Check out the _site folder, which is where Jekyll is generated, to see the difference between your project’s structure and the resulting site output.The listing of all pages in the root directory (which happens when you add a permalink property to the pages) is what allows the relative linking and offline viewing of the site to work.FrontmatterMake sure each page has frontmatter at the top like this:---title: Alertstags: [formatting]keywords: notes, tips, cautions, warnings, admonitionslast_updated: July 3, 2016summary: \"You can insert notes, tips, warnings, and important alerts in your content.\"sidebar: mydoc_sidebarpermalink: mydoc_alerts.html---Frontmatter is always formatted with three hyphens at the top and bottom. Your frontmatter must have a title and permalink value. All the other values are optional.Note that you cannot use variables in frontmatter.The following table describes each of the frontmatter that you can use with this theme:            Frontmatter      Required?      Description                  title      Required      The title for the page              tags      Optional      Tags for the page. Make all tags single words, with underscores if needed (rather than spaces). Separate them with commas. Enclose the whole list within brackets. Also, note that tags must be added to _data/tags_doc.yml to be allowed entrance into the page. This prevents tags from becoming somewhat random and unstructured. You must create a tag page for each one of your tags following the pattern shown in the tags folder. (Tag pages aren’t automatically created.)              keywords      Optional      Synonyms and other keywords for the page. This information gets stuffed into the page’s metadata to increase SEO. The user won’t see the keywords, but if you search for one of the keywords, it will be picked up by the search engine.              last_updated      Optional      The date the page was last updated. This information could helpful for readers trying to evaluate how current and authoritative information is. If included, the last_updated date appears in the footer of the page in rather small font.              summary      Optional      A 1-2 word sentence summarizing the content on the page. This gets formatted into the summary section in the page layout. Adding summaries is a key way to make your content more scannable by users (check out Jakob Nielsen’s site for a great example of page summaries.) The only drawback with summaries is that you can’t use variables in them.              permalink      Required      The permalink must match the filename in order for automated links to work. Additionally, you must include the “.html” in the filename. Do not put forward slashes around the permalink (this makes Jekyll put the file inside a folder in the output). When Jekyll builds the site, it will put the page into the root directory rather than leaving it in a subdirectory or putting it inside a folder and naming the file index.html. Having all files flattened in the root directory is essential for relative linking to work and for all paths to JS and CSS files to be valid.              datatable      Optional      ‘true’. If you add datatable: true in the frontmatter, scripts for the jQuery Datatables plugin get included on the page. You can see the scripts that conditionally appear by looking in the _layouts/default.html page.              toc      Optional      If you specify toc: false in the frontmatter, the page won’t have the table of contents that appears below the title. The toc refers to the list of jump links below the page title, not the sidebar navigation. You probably want to hide the TOC on the homepage and product landing pages.      Colons in page titlesIf you want to use a colon in your page title, you must enclose the title’s value in quotation marks.Page names and excluding files from outputsBy default, everything in your project is included in the output. You can exclude all files that don’t belong to that project by specifying the file name, the folder name, or by using wildcards in your configuration file:exclude:- filename.md- subfolder_name/- mydoc_*- gitignoreWildcards will exclude every match after the *.Saving pages as draftsIf you add published: false in the frontmatter, your page won’t be published. You can also move draft pages into the _drafts folder to exclude them from the build. With posts, you can also keep them as drafts by omitting the date in the title.Markdown or HTML formatPages can be either Markdown or HTML format (specified through either an .md or .html file extension).If you use Markdown, you can also include HTML formatting where needed. But if you’re format is HTML, you must add a markdown=\"1\" attribute to the element in order to use Markdown inside that HTML element:&lt;div markdown=\"1\"&gt;This is a [link](http://exmaple.com).&lt;/div&gt;For your Markdown files, note that a space or two indent will set text off as code or blocks, so avoid spacing indents unless intentional.If you have a lot of HTML, as long as the top and bottom tags of the HTML are flush left in a Markdown file, all the tags inside those bookend HTML tags will render as HTML, regardless of their indentation. (This can be especially useful for tables.)Page namesI recommend prefixing your page names with the product, such as “mydoc_pages” instead of just “pages.” This way if you have other products that also have topics with generic names such as “pages,” there won’t be naming conflicts.Additionally, consider adding the product name in parentheses after the title, such as “Pages (Mydoc)” so that users can clearly navigate different topics for each product.Kramdown MarkdownKramdown is the Markdown flavor used in the theme. This mostly aligns with Github-flavored Markdown, but with some differences in the indentation allowed within lists. Basically, Kramdown requires you to line up the indent between list items with the first starting character after the space in your list item numbering. See this blog post on Kramdown and Rouge for more details.You can use standard Multimarkdown syntax for tables. You can also use fenced code blocks with lexers specifying the type of code. The configuration file shows the Markdown processor and extensiosn:highlighter: rougemarkdown: kramdownkramdown: input: GFM auto_ids: true hard_wrap: false syntax_highlighter: rougeAutomatic mini-TOCsBy default, a TOC appears at the top of your pages and posts. If you don’t want the TOC to appear for a specific page, such as for a landing page or other homepage, add toc: false in the frontmatter of the page.The mini-TOC requires you to use the ## Markdown syntax for headings. If you use &lt;h2&gt; elements, you must add an ID attribute for the heading element in order for it to appear in the mini-TOC (for example, &lt;h2 id=\"mysampleid\"&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;.HeadingsUse pound signs before the heading title to designate the level. Note that kramdown requires headings to have one space before and after the heading. Without this space above and below, the heading won’t render into HTML.## Second-level headingResult:Second-level heading### Third-level headingResult:Third-level heading#### Fourth-level headingResult:Fourth-level headingHeadings with ID TagsIf you want to use a specific ID tag with your heading, add it like this:## Headings with ID Tags {#someIdTag}Then you can reference it with a link like this on the same page:[Some link](#someIdTag)Result:Some linkFor details about linking to headings on different pages, see Automated links to headings on pages.Specify a particular page layoutThe configuration file sets the default layout for pages as the “page” layout.You can create other layouts inside the layouts folder. If you create a new layout, you can specify that your page use your new layout by adding layout: mylayout.html in the page’s frontmatter. Whatever layout you specify in the frontmatter of a page will override the layout default set in the configuration file.CommentsDisqus, a commenting system, is integrated into the theme. In the configuration file, specify the Disqus code for the universal code, and Disqus will appear. If you don’t add a Disqus value, the Disqus form isn’t included."

"summary": "Version 5.0 of the Documentation theme for Jekyll changes some fundamental ways the theme works to provide product-specific sidebars, intended to accommodate a site where multiple products are grouped together on the same site rather than generated out as separate outputs.",
"body": "Unique sidebars for each productIn previous versions of the theme, I built the theme to generate different outputs for different scenarios based on various filtering attributes that might include product, version, platform, and audience variants.However, this model results in siloed outputs and lots of separate file directories to manage. Instead of having 30 separate sites for your content (or however many variants you might have been producing), in this version of the theme I’ve moved towards a strategy of having one site with multiple products.For each product, you can associate a unique sidebar with each of the product’s pages. This allows you to have all your documentation on one site, but with separate navigation that is tailored to a view of that product.You can still output to both web and PDF. And if you really need multiple site outputs, you can still do so by using multiple configuration files that trigger different builds. But my conclusion after using the multiple site output model for some years is that it’s a bad practice for tech comm.PermalinksWith this theme, since you’ll be publishing to one site, I’ve implement permalinks instead of relative links. Using permalinks means the way you store pages is much more flexible. You can store topics in folders and subfolders, etc., to any degree. But note that with permalinks you can’t view the content offline (outside of Jekyll’s preview server) nor on a separate site other than the one specified in the configuration file. Permalinks are how Jekyll was designed to work, and the sites just work better that way.Kramdown and RougeI also switched from redcarpet and Pygments to Kramdown and Rouge to align with the current direction of Jekyll 3.0. Kramdown is a Markdown filter (it’s slightly different from Github-flavored Markdown). Rouge is a syntax highlighter. Pygments had some dependencies on Python, which made it more cumbersome for Windows users.Blog featureI included a blog feature with this version of the theme. You can write posts and view them through the News link. There’s also an archive for blog posts that sorts posts by year.Additionally, the tagging system works across both the blog and pages, so your tags allow users to move laterally across the site based on topics they’re interested in. When you view a tag archive, the sidebar shows a list of tags.Updated documentationI updated the documentation for  the theme. The switch from the multi-site outputs to the single-site with multiple sidebars required updating a lot of different parts of the documentation and code.Fixed errorsPreviously I had some errors with the HTML that showed up in w3c HTML validator analyses. This caused some small problems in certain browsers or systems less tolerant of the errors. I fixed all of the errors.Accessing the old themeIf you want to access the old theme, you can still find it here."

Additionally, you can store pages in subdirectories. Templates for alerts and images are available.",
"body": "Relative linksYou can now view the site offline rather than solely through the Jekyll preview server or deployed on a web server. The linking approach in both the sidebar and with inline links uses relative linking throughout.Subfolders for pagesYou can creates folders and subfolders for your pages, similar to how you can store posts in folders and subfolders. When Jekyll builds the site, all pages get pushed into the root directory as single html files (rather than being pushed inside folders, or remaining in subfolders). See [Pages][mydoc_pages] for more details.Alerts templatesYou can use include templates for notes, tips, and warnings. These include templates make it easier to insert notes. If you make an error, you’re immediately made aware since the site won’t build. See [Alerts][mydoc_alerts] for more details.Image templatesSimilar to alerts, images also have include templates. You can insert both regular images and inline images, such as images that are a button or icon. See [Images][mydoc_images] for more details.Automated links using Markdown formattingInstead of using YAML references to handle links, I’ve switched to a Markdown reference style approach. A links.html file iterates through the sidebar files and formats the content in the Markdown reference. You then just use Markdown syntax for the links. See [Links][mydoc_hyperlinks] for more details.Workflow mapsIf you want to display a workflow map for a process, you can do so by adding some properties in your frontmatter. The workflow map helps guide users through a process. Both simple and complex workflow maps are available. For more details, see [Workflow maps][mydoc_workflow_maps].UpgradingIf you want to upgrade from an earlier version of the theme, I recommend that you download the new theme and copy of your Markdown files into the new theme. You’ll then need to make adjustments to your page frontmatter, to the sidebar table of contents, links, image references, and alert references. In short, there’s no easy upgrade path. But all of this won’t take too long if you don’t have mountains of content."

"url": "mydoc_search_configuration.html",
"summary": "The search feature uses JavaScript to look for keyword matches in a JSON file. The results show instant matches, but it doesn't provide a search results page like Google. Also, sometimes invalid formatting can break the JSON file.",
"body": "About searchThe search is configured through the search.json file in the root directory. The search is a simple search that looks at content in pages. It looks at titles, summaries, keywords, and tags.However, the search doesn’t work like google — you can’t hit return and see a list of results on the search results page, with the keywords in bold. Instead, this search shows a list of page titles that contain keyword matches. It’s fast, but simple.Excluding pages from searchBy default, every page is included in the search. Depending on the type of content you’re including, you may find that some pages will break the JSON formatting. If that happens, then the search will no longer work.If you want to exclude a page from search add search: exclude in the page’s frontmatter.Troubleshooting searchYou should exclude any files from search that you don’t want appearing in the search results. For example, if you have a tooltips.json file or prince-list.txt, don’t include it, as the formatting will break the JSON format.If any formatting in the search.json file is invalid (in the build), search won’t work. You’ll know that search isn’t working if no results appear when you start typing in the search box.If this happens, go directly to the search.json file in your browser, and then copy the content. Go to a JSON validator and paste in the content. Look for the line causing trouble. Edit the file to either exclude the page from search or fix the syntax so that it doesn’t invalidate the JSON. (Note that tabs in the body will invalidate JSON.)The search.json file already tries to strip out content that would otherwise make the JSON invalid.Including the body field in searchI’ve found that include the body field in the search creates too many problems, and so I’ve removed body from the search. You can see the results of including the body by adding this along with the other fields in search.json:      \"body\": \"{{ page.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | replace: '\\', '\\\\\\\\' | replace: '\"', '\\\\\"' | replace: '    ', '    '  }}\",Note that the last replace, | replace: '    ', '    ' , looks for any tab character and replaces it with four spaces. (Tab characters invalidate JSON.) If you run into other problematic formatting, you can use regex expressions to find and replace the content. See Regular Expressions for details on finding and replacing code.It’s possible that the formatting may not account for all the scenarios that would invalidate the JSON. (Sometimes it’s an extra comma after the last item that makes it invalid.)Note that including the body in the search creates other problems as well. The search results show the most immediate matches in the JSON file. If several topics have matches for the keyword in the body, these matches might appear before other files that have matches in the title, summary, or keywords. This is because this simple search does not provide any weighting mechanisms for the content.Customizing search resultsAt some point, you may want to customize the search results more. Here’s a little more detail that will be helpful. The search.json file retrieves various page values:---title: searchlayout: nonesearch: exclude---[{% for page in site.pages %}{% unless page.search == \"exclude\" %}{\"title\": \"{{ page.title | escape }}\",\"tags\": \"{{ page.tags }}\",\"keywords\": \"{{page.keywords}}\",\"url\": \"{{ page.url | remove: \"/\"}}\",\"summary\": \"{{page.summary | strip }}\"},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% for post in site.posts %}{\"title\": \"{{ post.title | escape }}\",\"tags\": \"{{ post.tags }}\",\"keywords\": \"{{post.keywords}}\",\"url\": \"{{ post.url }}\",\"summary\": \"{{post.summary | strip }}\"}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}]The _includes/topnav.html file then makes use of these values:&lt;li&gt;    &lt;!--start search--&gt;    &lt;div id=\"search-demo-container\"&gt;        &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"search-input\" placeholder=\"search...\"&gt;        &lt;ul id=\"results-container\"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;script src=\"js/jekyll-search.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;            SimpleJekyllSearch.init({                searchInput: document.getElementById('search-input'),                resultsContainer: document.getElementById('results-container'),                dataSource: 'search.json',                searchResultTemplate: '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{url}\" title=\"Search configuration\"&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;',    noResultsText: 'No results found.',            limit: 10,            fuzzy: true,    })    &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;!--end search--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;Where you see {url} and {title}, the search is retrieving the values for these as specified in the search.json file.More robust searchFor more robust search, consider integrating either Algolia or Swifttype."

Create the series buttonFirst create an include that contains your series button:&lt;div class=\"seriesContext\"&gt;    &lt;div class=\"btn-group\"&gt;        &lt;button type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" class=\"btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle\"&gt;Series Demo &lt;span class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;ol class=\"dropdown-menu\"&gt;            {% assign pages = site.pages | sort:\"weight\"  %}            {% for p in pages %}            {% if p.series == \"ACME series\" %}            {% if p.url == page.url %}            &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt; → {{p.weight}}. {{p.title}}&lt;/li&gt;            {% else %}            &lt;li&gt;                &lt;a href=\"{{p.url | remove: \"/\"}}\"&gt;{{p.weight}}. {{p.title}}&lt;/a&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;            {% endif %}            {% endif %}            {% endfor %}        &lt;/ol&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Change “ACME series” to the name of your series.Save this in your _includes/custom folder as something like series_acme.html. Warning: With pages, there isn’t a universal namespace created from tags or categories like there is with Jekyll posts. As a result, you have to loop through all pages. If you have a lot of pages in your site (e.g., 1,000+), then this looping will create a slow build time. If this is the case, you will need to rethink the approach to looping here.2. Create the “next” includeNow create another include for the Next button at the bottom of the page. Copy the following code, changing the series name to your series’name:&lt;p&gt;{% assign series_pages = site.tags.series_acme %}    {% for p in pages %}    {% if p.series == \"ACME series\" %}    {% assign nextTopic = page.weight | plus: \"1\"  %}    {% if p.weight == nextTopic  %}    &lt;a href=\"{{p.url}}\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"&gt;Next: {{p.weight}}  {{p.title}}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    {% endif %}    {% endif %}    {% endfor %}&lt;/p&gt;Change “acme” to the name of your series.Save this in your _includes/custom/mydoc folder as series_acme_next.html.3. Add the correct frontmatter to each of your series pagesNow add the following frontmatter to each page in the series:series: \"ACME series\"weight: 1.0With weights, Jekyll will treat 10 as coming after 1. If you have more than 10 items, consider changing plus: \"1.0\" to plus: \"0.1\".Additionally, if your page names are prefaced with numbers, such as “1. Download the code,” then the {{p.weight}} will create a duplicate number. In that case, just remove the {{p.weight}} from both code samples here.4. Add links to the series button and next button on each page.On each series page, add a link to the series button at the top and a link to the next button at the bottom.&lt;!-- your frontmatter goes here --&gt;{% include custom/series_acme.html %}&lt;!-- your page content goes here ... --&gt;{% include custom/series_acme_next.html %}Changing the series drop-down colorThe Bootstrap menu uses the primary class for styling. If you change this class in your theme, the Bootstrap menu should automatically change color as well. You can also just use another Bootstrap class in your button code. Instead of btn-primary, use btn-info or btn-warning. See [Labels][mydoc_labels] for more Bootstrap button classes.Using a collection with your seriesInstead of copying and pasting the button includes on each of your series, you could also create a collection and define a layout for the collection that has the include code. For more information on creating collections, see [Collections][mydoc_collections] for more details."

                                         Note:  This was mostly an experiment to see if I could break away from the hierarchical TOC and provide a different way of arranging the content. However, this layout is somewhat problematic because it doesn't allow you to browse other navigation options on the side while viewing a topic."

"tags": "getting_started",
"keywords": "sidebar, accordion, yaml, iteration, for loop, navigation, attributes, conditional filtering",
"url": "mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html",
"summary": "The sidebar navigation uses a jQuery component called Navgoco. The sidebar is a somewhat complex part of the theme that remembers your current page, highlights the active item, stays in a fixed position on the page, and more. This page explains a bit about how the sidebar was put together.",
"body": "Navgoco foundationThe sidebar uses the Navgoco jQuery plugin as its basis. Why not use Bootstrap? Navgoco provides a few features that I couldn’t find in Bootstrap:  Navgoco sets a cookie to remember the user’s position in the sidebar. If you refresh the page, the cookie allows the plugin to remember the state.  Navgoco inserts an active class based on the navigation option that’s open. This is essential for keeping the accordion open.  Navgoco includes the expand and collapse features of a sidebar.In short, the sidebar has some complex logic here. I’ve integrated Navgoco’s features with the sidebar.html and sidebar data files to build the sidebar. It’s probably the most impressive part of this theme. (Other themes usually aren’t focused on creating hierarchies of pages, but this kind of hierarchy is important in a documentation site.)Accordion sidebar featureThe sidebar.html file (inside the _includes folder) contains the .navgoco method called on the #mysidebar element.There are some options to set within the .navgoco method. The only noteworthy option is accordion. This option makes it so when you expand a section, the other sections collapse. It’s a way of keeping your navigation controls condensed.The value for accordion is a Boolean (true or false). By default, the accordion option is set as true. If you don’t want the accordion, set it to false. Note that there’s also a block of code near the bottom of sidebar.html that is commented out. Uncomment out that section to have the Collapse all and Expand All buttons appear.There’s a danger with setting the accordion to false. If you click Expand All and the sidebar expands beyond the dimensions of the browser, users will be stuck. When that happens, it’s hard to collapse it. As a best practice, leave the sidebar’s accordion option set to true.Fixed position sidebarThe sidebar has one other feature — this one from Bootstrap. If the user’s viewport is tall enough, the sidebar remains fixed on the page. This allows the user to scroll down the page and still keep the sidebar in view.In the customsscripts.js file in the js folder, there’s a function that adds an affix class if the height of the browser window is greater than 800 pixels. If the browser’s height is less than 800 pixels, the nav affix class does not get inserted. As a result, the sidebar can slide up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.Depending on your content, you may need to adjust 800 pixel number. If your sidebar is so long that having it in a fixed position makes it so the bottom of the sidebar gets cut off, increase the 800 pixel number here to a higher number.Opening sidebar links into external pagesIn the attributes for each sidebar item, if you use external_url instead of url, the theme will insert the link into an a href element that opens in a blank target.For example, the sidebar.html file contains the following code:{% if folderitem.external_url %}    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{folderitem.external_url}}\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;{{folderitem.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;```You can see that the `external_url` is a condition that applies a different formatting. Although this feature is available, I recommend putting any external navigation links in the top navigation bar instead of the side navigation bar.## Sidebar item highlightingThe sidebar.html file inserts an `active` class into the sidebar element when the `url` attribute in the sidebar data file matches the page URL.For example, the sidebar.html file contains the following code:```liquid{% elsif page.url == folderitem.url %}   &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{folderitem.url | remove: \"/\"}}\"&gt;{{folderitem.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;If the page.url matches the subfolderitem.url, then an active class gets applied. If not, the active class does not get applied.The page.url in Jekyll is a site-wide variable. If you insert {{page.url}} on a page, it will render as follows: /mydoc_sidebar_navigation.html. The url attribute in the sidebar item must match the page URL in order to get the active class applied.This is why the url value in the sidebar data file looks something like this:    - title: Understanding how the sidebar works      permalink: mydoc_understand_sidebar.html      output: web, pdfNote that the url does not include the project folder where the file is stored. This is because the site uses permalinks, which pulls the topics out of subfolders and places them into the root directory when the site builds.Now the page.url and the item.url can match and the active class can get applied. With the active class applied, the sidebar section remains open."

"summary": "If you're not sure whether Jekyll and this theme will support your requirements, this list provides a semi-comprehensive overview of available features.",
"body": "Before you get into exploring Jekyll as a potential platform for help content, you may be wondering if it supports some basic features needed to fulfill your tech doc requirements. The following table shows what is supported in Jekyll and this theme.Supported feautres            Features      Supported      Notes                  Content re-use      Yes      Supports re-use through Liquid. You can re-use variables, snippets of code, entire pages, and more. In DITA speak, this includes conref and keyref.              Markdown      Yes      You can author content using Markdown syntax. This is a wiki-like syntax for HTML that you can probably pick up in 10 minutes. Where Markdown falls short, you can use HTML. Where HTML falls short, you use Liquid, which is a scripting that allows you to incorporate more advanced logic.              Responsive design      Yes      Uses Bootstrap framework for responsive design.              Translation      Yes      I haven’t done a translation project yet (just a pilot test). Here’s the basic approach: Export the HTML pages and send them to a translation agency. Then create a new project for that language and insert the translated pages. Everything will be translated.              Collaboration      Yes      You collaborate with Jekyll projects the same way that developers collaborate with software projects. (You don’t need a CMS.) Because you’re working with text file formats, you can use any version control software (Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Bitbucket, etc.) as a CMS for your files.              Scalability      Yes      Your site can scale to any size. It’s up to you to determine how you will design the information architecture for your thousands of pages. You can choose what you display at first, second, third, fourth, and more levels, etc. Note that when your project has thousands of pages, the build time will be longer (maybe 1 minute per thousand pages?). It really depends on how many for loops you have iterating through the pages.              Lightweight architecture      Yes      You don’t need a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) architecture to get your site running. All of the building is done on your own machine, and you then push the static HTML files onto a server.              Skinnability      Yes      You can skin your Jekyll site to look identical to pretty much any other site online. If you have a UX team, they can really skin and design the site using all the tools familiar to the modern designer – JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, and more. Jekyll is built on the modern web development stack rather than the XML stack (XSLT, XPath, XQuery).              Support      Yes      The community for your Jekyll site isn’t so much other tech writers (as is the case with DITA) but rather the wider web development community. Jekyll Talk is a great resource. So is Stack Overflow.              Blogging features      Yes      There is a simple blogging feature. This appears as “news” and is intended to promote news that applies across products.              Versioning      Yes      Jekyll doesn’t version your files. You upload your files to a version control system such as Github. Your files are versioned there.              PC platform      Yes      Jekyll runs on Windows. Although the experience working on the command line is better on a Mac, Windows also works, especially now that Jekyll 3.0 dropped dependencies on Python, which wasn’t available by default on Windows.              jQuery plugins      Yes      You can use any jQuery plugins you and other JavaScript, CMS, or templating tools. However, note that if you use Ruby plugins, you can’t directly host the source files on Github Pages because Github Pages doesn’t allow Ruby plugins. Instead, you can just push your output to any web server. If you’re not planning to use Github Pages, there are no restrictions on any plugins of any sort. Jekyll makes it super easy to integrate every kind of plugin imaginable. This theme doesn’t actually use any plugins, so you can publish on Github if you want.              Bootstrap integration      Yes      This theme is built on Bootstrap. If you don’t know what Bootstrap is, basically this means there are hundreds of pre-built components, styles, and other elements that you can simply drop into your site. For example, the responsive quality of the site comes about from the Bootstrap code base.              Fast-loading pages      Yes      This is one of the Jekyll’s strengths. Because the files are static, they loading extremely fast, approximately 0.5 seconds per page. You can’t beat this for performance. (A typically database-driven site like WordPress averages about 2.5 + seconds loading time per page.) Because the pages are all static, it means they are also extremely secure. You won’t get hacked like you might with a WordPress site.              Themes      Yes      You can have different themes for different outputs. If you know CSS, theming both the web and print outputs is pretty easy.              Open source      Yes      This theme is entirely open source. Every piece of code is open, viewable, and editable. Note that this openness comes at a price — it’s easy to make changes that break the theme or otherwise cause errors.              Offline viewing      Yes      This theme uses relative linking throughout, so you can view the content offline and on any webserver without configuring urls and baseurls in your configuration file.      Features not availableThe following features are not available.            Features      Supported      Notes                  CMS interface      No      Unlike with WordPress, you don’t log into an interface and navigate to your files. You work with text files and preview the site dynamically in your browser. Don’t worry – this is part of the simplicy that makes Jekyll awesome. I recommend using WebStorm as your text editor.              WYSIWYG interface      No      I use WebStorm to author content, because I like working in text file formats. But you can use any Markdown editor you want (e.g., Lightpaper for Mac, Marked) to author your content.              Different outputs      No      This theme provides a single website output that contains documentation for multiple products. Unlike previous iterations of the theme, it’s not intended to support different outputs from the same content. However, you can easily set things up to do this by simply creating multiple configuration files and running different builds for each configuration file.              Robust search      No      The search feature is a simplistic JSON search. For more robust search, you should integrate Swiftype or Algolia. However, those services aren’t currently integrated into the theme.              Standardized templates      No      You can create pages with any structure you want. The theme does not enforce topic types such as a task or concept as the DITA specification does.              Integration with Swagger      No      You can link to a SwaggerUI output, but there is no built-in integration of SwaggerUI into this documentation theme.              Templates for endpoints      No      Although static site generators work well with API documentation, there aren’t any built-in templates specific to endpoints in this theme. You could construct your own, though.              eBook output      No      There isn’t an eBook output for the content.      "

If you want to use a jQuery datatable, then add datatable: true in a page’s frontmatter. This will load the right jQuery datatable scripts for the table on that page only (rather than loading the scripts on every page of the site.)              Also, you need to add this script to trigger the jQuery table on your page:              &lt;script&gt;$(document).ready(function(){    $('table.display').DataTable( {        paging: true,        stateSave: true,        searching: true    }        );});&lt;/script&gt;                            The available options for the datable are described in the datatable documentation, which is excellent.              Additionally, you must add a class of display to your tables. (You can change the class, but then you’ll need to change the trigger above from table.display to whatever class you want to you. You might have different triggers with different options for different tables.)              Since Markdown doesn’t allow you to add classes to tables, you’ll need to use HTML for any datatables. Here’s an example:              &lt;table id=\"sampleTable\" class=\"display\"&gt;   &lt;thead&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;         &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;         &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;         &lt;th&gt;Default Value&lt;/th&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/thead&gt;   &lt;tbody&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Parameter 1&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample description         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample type&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample default value&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Parameter 2&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample description         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample type&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample default value&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;       &lt;td&gt;Parameter 3&lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;Sample description       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;Sample type&lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;Sample default value&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Parameter 4&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample description         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample type&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;Sample default value&lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;                            This renders to the following:                                Food         Description         Category         Sample type                           Apples         A small, somewhat round and often red-colored, crispy fruit grown on trees.

Fruit         Golden                         Oranges           A spherical, orange-colored sweet fruit commonly grown in Florida and California.                      Fruit           Navel                         Notice a few features:                              You can keyword search the table. When you type a word, the table filters to match your word.                You can sort the column order.                You can page the results so that you show only a certain number of values on the first page and then require users to click next to see more entries.                            Read more of the datatable documentation to get a sense of the options you can configure. You should probably only use datatables when you have long, massive tables full of information.               Note:  Try to keep the columns to 3 or 4 columns only. If you add 5+ columns, your table may create horizontal scrolling with the theme. Additionally, keep the column heading titles short.                          "

The folder names and items I chose for each item could have been grouped in other ways with good reason.Tags allow you to go beyond the traditional hierarchical classification and provide other groupings. For example, the same item can belong to two different groups. You can also introduce other dimensions not used in your table of contents, such as platform-specific tags or audience-specific tags."

"summary": "Tags provide another means of navigation for your content. Unlike the table of contents, tags can show the content in a variety of arrangements and groupings. Implementing tags in this Jekyll theme is somewhat of a manual process.",
"body": "Add a tag to a pageYou can add tags to pages by adding tags in the frontmatter with values inside brackets, like this:---title: 5.0 Release Notespermalink: release_notes_5_0.htmltags: [formatting, single_sourcing]---Tags overview Note:  With posts, tags have a namespace that you can access with posts.tags.tagname, where tagname is the name of the tag. You can then list all posts in that tag namespace. But pages don’t off this same tag namespace, so you could actually use another key instead of tags. Nevertheless, I’m using the same tags approach for posts as with pages.To prevent tags from getting out of control and inconsistent, first make sure the tag appears in the _data/tags.yml file. If it’s not there, the tag you add to a page won’t be read. I added this check just to make sure I’m using the same tags consistently and not adding new tags that don’t have tag archive pages. Note: In contrast to WordPress, with Jekyll to get tags on pages you have to build out the functionality for tags so that clicking a tag name shows you all pages with that tag. Tags in Jekyll are much more manual.Additionally, you must create a tag archive page similar to the other pages named tag_{tagname}.html folder. This theme doesn’t auto-create tag archive pages.For simplicity, make all your tags single words (connect them with hyphens if necessary).Setting up tagsTags have a few components.      In the _data/tags.yml file, add the tag names you want to allow. For example:    allowed-tags:  - getting_started  - overview  - formatting  - publishing  - single_sourcing  - special_layouts  - content types            Create a tag archive file for each tag in your tags_doc.yml list. Name the file following the same pattern in the tags folder, like this: tag_collaboration.html.    Each tag archive file needs only this:    ---title: \"Collaboration pages\"tagName: collaborationsearch: excludepermalink: tag_collaboration.htmlsidebar: mydoc_sidebar---{% include taglogic.html %}         Note: In the _includes/mydoc folder, there’s a taglogic.html file. This file (included in each tag archive file) has common logic for getting the tags and listing out the pages containing the tag in a table with summaries or truncated excerpts. You don’t have to do anything with the file — just leave it there because the tag archive pages reference it.        Change the title, tagName, and permalink values to be specific to the tag name you just created.    By default, the _layouts/page.html file will look for any tags on a page and insert them at the bottom of the page using this code:  &lt;div class=\"tags\"&gt;{% if page.tags != null %}&lt;b&gt;Tags: &lt;/b&gt;{% assign projectTags = site.data.tags.allowed-tags %}{% for tag in page.tags %}{% if projectTags contains tag %}&lt;a href=\"{{ \"tag_\" | append: tag | append: \".html\" }}\" class=\"btn btn-default navbar-btn cursorNorm\" role=\"button\"&gt;{{page.tagName}}{{tag}}&lt;/a&gt;{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}&lt;/div&gt;Because this code appears on the _layouts/page.html file by default, you don’t need to do anything in your page to get the tags to appear. However, if you want to alter the placement or change the button color, you can do so within the _includes/taglogic.html file.You can change the button color by changing the class on the button from btn-info to one of the other button classes bootstrap provides. See [Labels][mydoc_labels] for more options on button class names.Retrieving pages for a specific tagIf you want to retrieve pages outside of a particular tag_archive page, you could use this code:Getting started pages:&lt;ul&gt;{% for page in site.pages %}{% for tag in page.tags %}{% if tag == \"getting_started\" %}&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{page.url | remove: \"/\" }}\"&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;Here’s how that code renders:Getting started pages:Documentation for Cloud Computing and Data ScienceAbout the theme authorAbout Ruby, Gems, Bundler, and other prerequisitesInstall Jekyll on MacPagesPostsRelease notes 5.0Release notes 6.0Sidebar NavigationSupportSupported featuresIf you want to sort the pages alphabetically, you have to apply a sort filter:Getting started pages:&lt;ul&gt;{% assign sorted_pages = (site.pages | sort: 'title') %}{% for page in sorted_pages %}{% for tag in page.tags %}{% if tag == \"getting_started\" %}&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{page.url | remove: \"/\" }}\"&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;Here’s how that code renders:Getting started pages:About Ruby, Gems, Bundler, and other prerequisitesAbout the theme authorDocumentation for Cloud Computing and Data ScienceInstall Jekyll on MacPagesPostsRelease notes 5.0Release notes 6.0Sidebar NavigationSupportSupported featuresEfficiencyAlthough the tag approach here uses for loops, these are somewhat inefficient on a large site. Most of my tech doc projects don’t have hundreds of pages (like my blog does). If your project does have hundreds of pages, this for loop approach with tags is going to slow down your build times.Without the ability to access pages inside a universal namespace with the page type, there aren’t many workarounds here for faster looping.With posts (instead of pages), since you can access just the posts inside posts.tag.tagname, you can be a lot more efficient with the looping.Still, if the build times are getting long (e.g., 1 or 2 minutes per build), look into reducing the number of for loops on your site.Empty tags?If your page shows “tags:” at the bottom without any value, it could mean a couple of things:  You’re using a tag that isn’t specified in your allowed tags list in your tags.yml file.  You have an empty tags: [] property in your frontmatter.If you don’t want tags to appear at all on your page, remove the tags property from your frontmatter.Remembering the right tagsSince you may have many tags and find it difficult to remember what tags are allowed, I recommend creating a template that prepopulates all your frontmatter with all possible tags. Then just remove the tags that don’t apply.See [WebStorm Text Editor][mydoc_webstorm_text_editor] for tips on creating file templates in WebStorm."

The _includes/sidebar.html file loops through the values in the _data/sidebar.yml file. There are if statements that check whether the conditions (as specified in the conditions.html file) are met. If the sidebar.yml item doesn’t have the right output, then it won’t get displayed in the sidebar. It would instead get skipped.Sidebar isn’t collapsedIf the sidebar levels aren’t collapsed, usually your JavaScript is broken somewhere. Open the JavaScript Console and look to see where the problem is. If one script breaks, then other scripts will break too, so troubleshooting it is a little tricky.Search isn’t workingIf the search isn’t working, check the JSON validity in the search.json file in your output folder. Usually something is invalid. Identify the problematic line, fix the file, or put search: exclude in the frontmatter of the file to exclude it from search."

"body": "About text editors and WebStormThere are a variety of text editors available, but I like WebStorm the best because it groups files into projects, which makes it easy to find all instances of a text string, to do find and replace operations across the project, and more.If you decide to use WebStorm, here are a few tips on configuring the editor.Remove unnecessary pluginsBy default, WebStorm comes packaged with a lot more functionality than you probably need. You can lighten the editor by removing some of the plugins. Go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Plugins and clear the check boxes of plugins you don’t need.Set default tab indent to 3 spaces instead of 4You can set the way the tab works, and whether it uses spaces or a tab character. For details, see Code Style. JavaScript in WebStorm’s help.            On a Mac, go to **WebStorm      Preferences      Editor      Code Style      Other File Types. Don’t select the “Use tab character” check box. Set **3 for the Tab size and Indent check boxes.                  On Windows, go to **File      Settings      Editor      Code Style      Other File Types** to access the same menu.      Add the Markdown Support pluginSince you’ll be writing in Markdown, having color coding and other support for Markdown is important. Install the Markdown Support plugin by going to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Plugins and clicking Install JetBrains Plugin. Search for Markdown Support. (I would avoid the Multimarkdown plugin — it seemed to make all my dashes in frontmatter tags extend half way across the page.)Enable Soft Wraps (word wrapping)Most likely you’ll want to enable soft wraps, which wraps lines rather than extending them out forever and requiring you to scroll horizontally to see the text. To enable softwrapping, go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; General and see the Soft Wraps section. Select the Use soft wraps in editor check box.Exclude a directoryWhen you’re searching for content, you don’t want to edit any file that appears in the _site directory. You can exclude a directory from Webstorm by right-clicking the directory and choosing Mark Directory As and then selecting Excluded.Set tabs to 3 spacesYou can set the default number of spaces a tab sets, including whether Webstorm uses a tab character or spaces. You want spaces, and you want to set this to default number of spaces to 3 spaces instead of 4. Note that this is due to the way Kramdown handles the continuation of lists.When you intercept a list with a paragraph or code sample, the indentation of the intercepting paragraph or list must align with the beginning of the first character after the space in the list item numbering. This is typically 3 spaces, not 4. Note that this style differs from the Github-flavored Markdown style. (Welcome to the world of subtle and infuriating discrepancies between Markdown flavors.)To set the indentation, see the “Tabs and Indents” topic in this Code Style. Javascript topic in Webstorm’s help.ShortcutsIt can help to learn a few key shortcuts:            Command      Shortcuts                  Shift + Shift      Allows you to find a file by searching for its name.              Shift + Command + F      Find in whole project. (WebStorm uses the term “Find in path”.)              Shift + Command + R      Replace in whole project. (Again, WebStorm calls it “Replace in path.”)              Command + F      Find on page              Shift + R      Replace on page              Right-click &gt; Add to Favorites      Allows you to add files to a Favorites section, which expands below the list of files in the project pane.              Shift + tab      Applies outdenting (opposite of tabbing)              Shift + Function + F6      Rename a file              Command + Delete      Delete a file              Command + 2      Show Favorites pane              Shift + Option + F      Add to Favorites       Tip:  If these shortcut keys aren't working for you, make sure you have the \"Max OS X 10.5+\" keymap selected. Go to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Keymap and select it there. Finding filesWhen I want to find a file, I browse to the file in the preview site and copy the page name in the URL. Then in Webstorm I press Shift twice and paste in the file name. The search feature automatically highlights the file I want, and I press Enter.Identifying changed filesWhen you have the Git and Github integration, changed files appear in blue. This lets you know what needs to be committed to your repository.Creating file templatesRather than insert the frontmatter by hand each time, it’s much faster to simply create a Jekyll template. To create a Jekyll template in WebStorm:      Right-click a file in the list of project files, and select New &gt; Edit File Templates.    If you don’t see the Edit File Templates option, you may need to create a file template first. Go to File &gt; Default Settings &gt; Editor &gt; File and Code Templates. Create a new file template with an md extension, and then close and restart WebStorm. Then repeat this step and you will see the File Templates option appear in the right context menu.    In the upper-left corner of the dialog box that appears, click the + button to create a new template.      Name it something like Jekyll page. Insert the frontmatter you want, and save it.    To use the Jekyll template, when you create a new file in your WebStorm project, you can select your Jekyll file template.  Disable pair quotesBy default, each time you type ', WebStorm will pair the quote (creating two quotes). You can disable this by going to WebStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Smartkeys. Clear the Insert pair quotes check box."

Also, the links must be manually coded HTML like those shown, not automated Markdown links. (This is because the boxes are linked.)

The map_name gets used as the name of the included file.  Complex workflow mapsThe simpler user workflow allows for 5 workflow steps. If you have a more complex workflow, with multiple possible steps, branching, and more, consider using a complex workflow map. This map uses modals to show a list of instructions and links for each step.      Create an include at _includes/custom/usermapcomplex.html, where usermapcomplex.html contains the workflow and links you want. See the usermapcomplex.html as an example. The code in that file simply implements Bootstrap modals to create the pop-up boxes. Add your custom content inside the modal body:    ```    This is just dummy text ... Your first steps should be to get started. You will need to do the following:                Sample 6        Sample 7        Sample 8        If you run into any of these setup issues, you must solve them before you can continue on.                  ```    The existing usermapcomplex.html file just has 3 workflow square modals. If you need more, duplicate the modal code. In the duplicated code, make sure you make the following values in red unique (but the same within the same modal):     &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-lg modalButton3\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal3\"&gt;Publish your app&lt;/button&gt;              &lt;div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"myModal3\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"myModalLabel\"&gt;         For each topic where you want the modal to appear, insert the following properties in your frontmatter:    ---title: Sample 6 Topickeywords: samplesummary: \"This is just a sample topic...\"sidebar: product2_sidebarpermalink: p2_sample6complex_map: truemap_name: usermapcomplexbox_number: 1toc: falsefolder: product2---    When your frontmatter contains complex_map equal to true, the following code gets activated in the page layout.html file:    ```In the page.html layout, the following code gets activated when map equals true:    ```    {% if page.complex_map == true %}    &lt;script&gt;    $(document).ready ( function(){        $('.modalButton{{page.box_number}}').addClass('active');    });&lt;/script&gt;    {% include custom/{{page.map_name}}.html %}    {% endif %}```  ```      "

"summary": "YAML is a format that relies on white spacing to separate out the various elements of content. Jekyll lets you use Liquid with YAML as a way to parse through the data. Storing items for your table of contents is one of the most common uses of YAML with Jekyll.",
"body": "OverviewOne of the most interesting features of Jekyll is the ability to separate out data elements from formatting elements using a combination of YAML and Liquid. This setup is most common when you’re trying to create a table of contents.Not many Jekyll themes actually have a robust table of contents, which is critical when you are creating any kind of documentation or reference material that has a lot of pages.Here’s the basic approach in creating a table of contents. You store your data items in a YAML file using YAML syntax. (I’ll go over more about YAML syntax in a later section.) You then create your HTML structure in another file, such as sidebar.html. You might leverage one of the many different table of content frameworks (such as Navgoco) that have been created for this HTML structure.Then, using Liquid syntax for loops and conditions, you access all of those values from the data file and splice them into HTML formatting. This will become more clear as we go through some examples.YAML overviewRather than just jump into YAML at the most advanced level, I’m going to start from ground zero with an introduction to YAML and how you access basic values in your data files using Jekyll.Note that you don’t actually have to use Jekyll when using YAML. YAML is used in a lot of other systems and is a format completely independent of Jekyll. However, because Jekyll uses Liquid, it gives you a lot of power to parse through your YAML data and make use of it.YAML itself doesn’t do anything on its own — it’s just a way of storing your data in a specific structure that other utilities can parse.YAML basicsYou can read about YAML from a lot of different sources. Here are some basic characteristics of YAML:  YAML (“YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) doesn’t use markup tags. This means you won’t see any kind of angle brackets. It uses white space as a way to form the structure. This makes YAML much more human readable.  Because YAML does use white space for the structure, YAML is extremely picky about the exactness of spaces. If you have just one extra space somewhere, it can cause the whole file to be invalid.  For each new level in YAML, you indent two spaces. Each level provides a different access point for the content. You use dot notation to access each new level.  Because tabs are not universally implemented the same way in editors, a tab might not equate to two spaces. In general, it’s best to manually type two spaces to create a new level in YAML.  YAML has several types of elements. The most common are mappings and lists. A mapping is simply a key-value pair. A list is a sequence of items. List start with hyphens.  Items at each level can have various properties. You can create conditions based on the properties.  You can use “for” loops to iterate through a list.I realize a lot of this vague and general; however, it will become a lot more clear as we go through some concrete examples.In the _data/mydoc folder, there’s a file called samplelist.yml. All of these examples come from that file.Example 1: Simple mappingYAML:name:  husband: Tom  wife: ShannonMarkdown + Liquid:Husband's name: {{site.data.samplelist.name.husband}}Wife's name: {{site.data.samplelist.name.wife}}Notice that in order to access the data file, you use site.data.samplelist. mydoc is the folder, and samplelist is the name of the YAML file.Result:Husband’s name: TomWife’s name: ShannonExample 2: Line breaksYAML:feedback: &gt;  This is my feedback to you.  Even if I include linebreaks here,  all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.block: |    This pipe does something a little different.    It preserves the breaks.    This is really helpful for code samples,    since you can format the code samples with       the appropriateMarkdown:**Feedback**This is my feedback to you. Even if I include linebreaks here, all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.  **Block**This pipe does something a little different. It preserves the breaks.This is really helpful for code samples, since you can format the code samples with   the appropriate   white spacing.Result:FeedbackThis is my feedback to you. Even if I include linebreaks here, all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.BlockThis pipe does something a little different. It preserves the breaks.This is really helpful for code samples, since you can format the code samples with   the appropriate   white spacing.The right angle bracket &gt; allows you to put the value on the next lines (which must be indented). Even if you create a line break, the output will remove all of those line breaks, creating one paragraph.The pipe | functions like the angle bracket in that it allows you to put the values for the mapping on the next lines (which again must be indented). However, the pipe does preserve all of the line breaks that you use. This makes the pipe method ideal for storing code samples.Example 3: Simple listYAML:bikes:  - title: mountain bikes  - title: road bikes  - title: hybrid bikesMarkdown + Liquid:{% for item in site.data.samplelist.bikes %}* {{item.title}}{% endfor %}Result:      mountain bikes        road bikes        hybrid bikes  Here we use a “for” loop to get each item in the bikes list. By using .title we only get the title property from each list item.Example 4: List itemsYAML:salesteams:- title: Regions subfolderitems:   - location: US   - location: Spain   - location: FranceMarkdown + Liquid:{% for item in site.data.samplelist.salesteams %}&lt;h3&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;{% for entry in item.subitems %}&lt;li&gt;{{entry.location}}&lt;/li&gt;{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;{% endfor %}Result:RegionsHopefully you can start to see how to wrap more complex formatting around the YAML content. When you use a “for” loop, you choose the variable of what to call the list items. The variable you choose to use becomes how you access the properties of each list item. In this case, I decided to use the variable item. In order to get each property of the list item, I used item.subitems.Each list item starts with the hyphen –.  You cannot directly access the list item by referring to a mapping. You only loop through the list items. If you wanted to access the list item, you would have to use something like [1], which is how you access the position in an array. You cannot access a list item like you can access a mapping key.Example 5: Table of contentsYAML:toc:  - title: Group 1    subfolderitems:      - page: Thing 1      - page: Thing 2      - page: Thing 3  - title: Group 2    subfolderitems:      - page: Piece 1      - page: Piece 2      - page: Piece 3  - title: Group 3    subfolderitems:      - page: Widget 1      - page: Widget 2 it's      - page: Widget 3Markdown + Liquid:{% for item in site.data.samplelist.toc %}&lt;h3&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;{% for entry in item.subfolderitems %}&lt;li&gt;{{entry.page}}&lt;/li&gt;{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;{% endfor %}Result:Group 1Thing 1Thing 2Thing 3Group 2Piece 1Piece 2Piece 3Group 3Widget 1Widget 2Widget 3This example is similar to the previous one, but it’s more developed as a real table of contents.Example 6: VariablesYAML:something: &amp;hello Greetings earthling!myref: *helloMarkdown:{{ site.data.samplelist.myref }}Result:Greetings earthling!This example is notably different. Here I’m showing how to reuse content in YAML file. If you have the same value that you want to repeat in other mappings, you can create a variable using the &amp; symbol. Then when you want to refer to that variable’s value, you use an asterisk * followed by the name of the variable.In this case the variable is &amp;hello and its value is Greetings earthling! In order to reuse that same value, you just type *hello.I don’t use variables much, but that’s not to say they couldn’t be highly useful. For example, let’s say you put name of the product in parentheses after each title (because you have various products that you’re providing documentation for in the same site). You could create a variable for that product name so that if you change how you’re referring to it, you wouldn’t have to change all instances of it in your YAML file.Example 7: Positions in listsYAML:about: - zero - one - two - threeMarkdown:{{ site.data.samplelist.about[0] }}Result:zeroYou can see that I’m accessing one of the items in the list using [0]. This refers to the position in the array where a list item is. Like most programming languages, you start counting at zero, not one.I wanted to include this example because it points to the challenge in getting a value from a specific list item. You can’t just call out a specific item in a list like you can with a mapping. This is why you usually iterate through the list items using a “for” loop.Example 8: Properties from list items at specific positionsYAML:numbercolors: - zero:   properties: red - one:   properties: yellow - two:   properties: green - three:   properties: blueMarkdown + Liquid:{{ site.data.samplelist.numbercolors[0].properties }}Result:redThis example is similar as before; however, in this case were getting a specific property from the list item in the zero position.Example 9: ConditionsYAML:mypages:- section1: Section 1  audience: developers  product: acme  url: facebook.com- section2: Section 2  audience: writers  product: acme  url: google.com- section3: Section 3  audience: developers  product: acme  url: amazon.com- section4: Section 4  audience: writers  product: gizmo  url: apple.com- section5: Section 5  audience: writers  product: acme  url: microsoft.comMarkdown + Liquid:{% for sec in site.data.samplelist.mypages %}{% if sec.audience == \"writers\" %}* {{sec.url}}{% endif %}{% endfor %}Result:      google.com        apple.com        microsoft.com  This example shows how you can use conditions in order to selectively get the YAML content. In your table of contents, you might have a lot of different pages. However, you might only want to get the pages for a particular audience. Conditions lets you get only the items that meet those audience attributes.Now let’s adjust the condition just a little. Let’s add a second condition so that the audience property has to be writers and the product property has to be gizmo. This is how you would write it:{% for sec in site.data.samplelist.mypages %}{% if sec.audience == \"writers\" and sec.product == \"gizmo\" %}* {{sec.url}}{% endif %}{% endfor %}And here is the result:  apple.comMore resourcesFor more examples and explanations, see this helpful post on tournemille.com: How to create data-driven navigation in Jekyll."

"body": "Sample ContentLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).More sample contentContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

"body": "Sample ContentLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).More sample contentContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).More sample contentContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

These grants can have a value as high as $20,000 and a typical duration of 12 months. They are considered non-renewable after that time.Having a research credit grant of this type is independent of writing a grant proposal to a funding agency such as NIH or NSF. If a cloud research credit grant is secured by you en route to writing aproposal to an agency like NSF: You may wish to reference that grant in your proposal as a means of defraying computing costs in year one of the proposed effort.Research credit cloud accounts are distinct from paid accounts secured under the UW BAA with AWS and Azure. Those accounts have legal terms associated with them (see respective overview pages herein: Azure overview and AWS overview.Federally funded researchFAQQ: How fast/powerful is a given instance?A: You can read about instance types on the vendor’s cloud console and/or information pages. For example AWS EC2 instances are written up here.From the Linux command line you can issue commands such as:% lscpu% cat /proc/cpuinfoIt is possible that (from evidence circa 2012) a certain degree of CPU type heterogeneity can introduce on the order of 10% performance variation."

"body": "IntroductionThe purpose of this page is to walk through GitHub procedures with two implementations in mind:  A Jekyll implementation (e.g. http://cloudmaven.org) that renders markdown (.md) properly.  A Jupyter Notebook: Both static rendering and as a backup of a dynamic instance.Using a code repository (distinguish: not a data repository) like GitHub accomplishes:  You have a safe back-up of your code base  You can work on your code with others simultaneously, managing versions  You can take advantage of interpreters like Jekyll that build documentation pages  You can maintain versions of your code for development, testing and deployment (use)LinksGitHubWarnings  For a Jekyll instance such as this website: Work from the gh-pages branch, not the master.          You risk ‘breaking’ your GitHub implementation if you work on the wrong branch.        If GitHub is balking (throwing fail/error messages): Use ‘git status’ on the command line and diagnose the output.          For example a ‘rebase’ in progress (unresolved) can be halted using ‘git rebase abort’ but be sure you know what you are doing.      Once ‘git status’ is ok you can return to business as usual.        GitHub can sometimes be mysterious. When in doubt: Make an independent local copy of the repo folder first.  While Jekyll renders markdown there does not appear to be a reliably good way of rendering LaTeX.          In research this is important. Until there is a fix we are obliged to render to pngs and embed them as images.      GitHub BasicsGitHub APIGitHub raw file recoveryGitHub Commit from Command Line on WindowsThis assumes you already have a GitHub repo and a local copy. You have modified something in the local copy and you have permission to just execute a push that will override anything on the GitHub repo.  Start the Power Shell on a Windows machine connected to the internet.  Navigate to the base directory of the repository.  Issue these in sequence; note I have paraphrased what they do          git status                             state the current status of the local repository                  Is there a ‘rebase’ in the response? You may need to issue ‘git rebase abort’ but be sure this is safe to do                    git pull                               update my copy of the repo from GitHub to latest      git add .                              stage everything new recursively (this folder on down) for a commit      git commit -m “a comment”              creates a ‘commit’ of the current state of the local repo      git push origin master                 update the GitHub repo based on mine                  This push may require login information: login name and password                    Jekyll on GitHubJekyll is a GitHub repo that includes rendering software ‘for itself’. That is: If you make a copy of the Jekyll repo and rename it something else, like ‘Hyde’, it will be visible on GitHub as both a normal repo (let’s call that the back door) and as a rendered website (the front door). The way this works is your version will start out with some default files that have the markdown file extension ‘.md’. These you can modify to suit your own purposes. When you hit the front door Jekyll manually creates from these markdown files some pretty html content which renders in your browser. Follow the recipe provided by the Jekyll documentation and you can start building out content in Hyde. This is what we have done with http://cloudmaven.org.Notice that there is a side comment (Kilroy) needed here about the distinction between the front door URL and the DNS entry.Jupyter GitHub repo on AWS EC2Suppose your EC2-based Jupyter Notebook is publicly visible. It might be password-protected (it is by default) but passwords have a way of getting handed around and this is not a highly secure situation. Someone logs on to your Notebook and deletes a page or makes some not-too-useful changes. You want to revert to the old version: This sounds like a job for GitHub.Install the git utility on the EC2 instance: First ssh via PuTTY (as I am using a Windows machine).Take care of updating the Operating System firstInterestingly this takes twenty minutes or so; and I have to babysit it; plus a reboot. It is an administrative task even though I am on the cloud.Now I can run% sudo apt-get install githowever I find that ‘git’ is already installed; so that is actually not necessary in this case.I want to make a repo from the Notebooks folder so% cd Notebooks% git init% git add .% git commit -m \"starting othermathclub git repo\"In browser go to http://github.com/myname and Create a new Repo (with a README).Grab the repo address to the clipboard; call that ‘link’; back on the EC2 instance:% git remote add origin 'link'% git push origin master(fails because the README file at the GitHub repo doesn’t exist here)% git stash% git pull 'link' masterThis goes to some little text editor… ctrl-x to get out of it.% git push origin masterFails because the data folder contains a file larger than 100MB; so the lesson here is don’t put large files in a repo unless you pay for the extra storage account.I relocate the data folder outside the repo folder.% mv data ..This proves to be a mistake, it would seem. Subsequent efforts to commit/push do not go well. I could also have added the offending large file to .gitignore but I chose this method instead, just by-the-by.Finally we come up with a convoluted solution:% git filter-branch -f --index-filter \"git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch data\" -- --allThis seems to convince (see screencap) git that the two large datafiles really are not part of the repo.We then proceed with add . (which adds the entire current directory to some entity) and commit (which I sorta get) and push origin master.Git short-course notesNotes from a class offered at the WRF Data Science Studio by the eScience Institute, January 13 2017. (Bernease Herman is the instructor.)&gt; git add FILEPATH                 -&gt; stages new material; up until this is done the stuff in FILEPATH is \"untracked\"&gt; git commit -m \"message\"  -&gt; commits those changes to the repoThis is local and (after iteration) produces a stack of changes. Git push and git pull will interact with a remote repo.WARNING: Using stash is only advised for one stash.&gt; git stash                    will only stash tracked files&gt; git stash -u                 will also stash un-tracked files (they exist but have not been added)&gt; git stash apply              will re-instate the stash into its former stateBranchesLet’s try a great idea to see if it works out; if so we will bring it back in; the usual diverge / merge diagram.&gt; git branch feature1&gt; git branch   feature1*  master&gt; git branch -d feature1             deletes the branchLet’s ignore that delete and assume feature1 branch exists.&gt; git checkout feature1                               'checkout' is the branch choice command&gt; git checkout master              So the actual chain of events would be (in git command sequence)&gt; git branch f1&gt; git checkout f1&gt; git branch                                  verify we are working on the f1 branch&gt; vi file.txt                                    edit and save file we want to change&gt; git add file.txt                          stage that file&gt; git commit -m \"msg\"              commit that change (again this is to branch f1)&gt; git checkout master&gt; git merge f1                             merges f1 (including the new commit) with master&gt; git branch                                 just to note that both branches still exist&gt; git branch -d f1                       deletes the f1 branch; now only master existsNotice that with the ability to create branches we can work on multiple versions of the same code base in parallel.WARNING The reason stash exists is to hang on to stuff without a commit. Otherwise: Commit is necessary.Now the GitHub website might have a public repo that I would like to work on. Fork to my own GitHub account and copy the URL&gt; cd GitHub                                                   that is: Go to the parent directory of where we want stuff&gt; git clone &lt;URL-from-above&gt;Triangle conceptSuppose we have a project leader Valentina and we want to work with her. She maintains her copy of the code; and thereis our GitHub repo as well. We thirdly have our local repo creating a triangle. The process will be to generate changes and then request that Valentina integrates them into her repo which is the main one. We work locally, integrate with our online GitHub.comrepo, and then issue pull requests to Valentina from there.  We want a triangle of 3 repos: Local, my GitHub, and Valentinas.  We give the latter two informal names (although ‘origin’ is a default): origin and upstream.upstream will be Valentina’s. origin will be our online repo at GitHub.  We make local changes.  We can pull from Valentina to stay up to date.  We can push to ‘origin’ (our GitHub.com repo)  We can make requests to Valentina (pull request) to grab our changes from our ‘origin’ repo.  We make these pull requests from the browser / GitHub repo; not from our command line.‘git pull origin master’ means I update my local copy from my GitHub repo (not the source repo)"
