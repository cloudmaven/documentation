Neurohackweek is an annual 5-day workshop held at the University of Washington eScience Institute.
The workshop convened more than 40 participants: graduate students, post-docs, faculty and research staff from all over the US and from the 
UK and the Netherlands, from Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science and other fields. The workshop was structured as part conference, 
part summer school and part hackathon. During the week participants took part in workshops and tutorials, presented their work in talks, 
and worked in small teams on projects or *hacks* where results were presented at the end of the week. 
Video recordings of some of presentations may be found in

## Cloud work

On the second day of the workshop Cameron Craddock (Child Mind Institute, NY) presented a morning tutorial on using the AWS public
cloud for neuroimaging applications. The materials used for this tutorial are available on the 
[Neurohackweek GitHub account](https://github.com/neurohackweek/NI_cloud_computing).

For this tutorial we provided participants with AWS IAM User credentials. They were thereby able to explore several options of 
neuroimaging compute pipelines with AWS, primarily built on EC2 and S3 technologies. 

### Four cloud projects

1. A system for running BIDS applications. These are docker containers for neuroimaging pipelines.
Preprocessed data from the ABIDE initiative was used. (kilroy citation needed) Further developed 
is needed and (kilroy) should be elaborated here together with a timeline and other planning notes. 
The end result will greatly simplify user access to high powered neuroimaging pipelines; cf BIDS-Apps (Kilroy).

2. An implementation of the NPAIRS framework: Using a pre-configured AMI from Cameron, this project added 
nodes, installed python modules to the nodes, and ran machine learning scripts on the nodes. (Kilroy what are these
nodes? VM nodes or some other meaning?) Participants found it easy to use a pre-built AMI but a little bit 
tricky to install modules to nodes. AWS or other cloud computing would be good for running time-consuming and 
parallel jobs that do not need lots of intermediate human interaction.  Kilroy more elaboration pls.

3. Collaborative Jupyter on AWS EC2: providing easy access to and storage of the ABIDE data and serial processing of 
scripts. The scripts for this project were then run in parallel on AWS, making it easy to then deploy them 
on local clusters at the University of Oregon and at MIT when participants returned home. This team had 
some difficulty with credentials when trying to create new nodes. Quickly debugging these kinds of issues 
in the context of a hackathon is a challenge for the organizers. Kilroy more details please.

4. Preprocess the [CoRR dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fcp-indi/data/Projects/CORR): An AMI with the newest 
version (v0.4.0) of the C-PAC pipeline software was created, and Starcluster was used to launch and manage 
20 EC2 instances with the goal of preprocessing all of CoRR's datasets. Since CoRR  is so large (1629 subjects; 
3357 anatomical scans; 5093 resting state functional scans), the instances didn't finish running before the end 
of Neurohackweek, but the setup during the week will allow the team to continue the work. Kilroy please define
fMRI.


## Post-workshop evaluation 

A survey distributed on the last day of the workshop asked participants to comment on *delta-skills*
and *delta-learning* that occurred during the workshop. 

- How much knowledge about cloud computing did you have coming into Neurohackweek?

- How much did you learn about cloud computing during Neurohackweek?

Kilroy need some fill-in here!

In free form responses when asked "What did you learn?" several participants mentioned cloud computing. For example: 

- "Learned rudimentary python and javascript, got a refresher on git/github, was introduced to many new tools like cloud computing."

- "I learned how to use a bunch of tools I'd heard about but wasn't sure how to actually get working with my own data. I also 
worked with a great team to ask a scientific question using shared Jupyter notebooks on the AWS cloud." 

On the other hand several participants expressed frustration at not having enough time to learn more about these topics. 
When asked "What would you have liked to learn more about in Neurohackweek?", a few participants responded that more time 
should have been devoted to cloud computing. For example: 

- "I couldn't get the cloud computing to work and I would very much have liked to learn more about it (at a more basic level... 
perhaps in a format like the github lecture... step by step so anyone can follow along and everyone has accomplished executing 
the mission-critical steps)."

- "I wasn't able to absorb as much as I wanted about cloud computing. It was too much information for the limited time."

- "If we'd had more time it would have been nice to have known what other folk are working on. I also need more time to 
understand the cloud computing/storage/docker implementations."

## Conclusion

Incorporating cloud computing in Neurohackweek was a ‘multiple win’ proposition. It facilitated projects by providing simple access 
for the participants to key neuroimaging computational tools. It helped identify bottlenecks to fix in cloud use. By training 
the participants Neurohackweek advanced the cultural shift in building and sharing open analytical tools in domain research. 
Finally of course Neurohackweek helped build awareness of the strengths of cloud computing. 

UW IT Research Computing will continue to work with the event organizer Ariel Rokem and with this community to expand and solidify 
the contribution of cloud computing to this important research. This continuation will include provision of compute resources, hosting 
training sessions and supporting consultation with AWS solution architects. 
We encourage other research communities to contact us about following the Neurohackweek model for community-building in other 
respective domains.
