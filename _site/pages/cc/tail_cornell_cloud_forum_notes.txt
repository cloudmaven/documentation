	* Have a process...
	* And here are our three patterns for solving problems
		* cloud formation template: How to create (and destroy) resources
			* JSON, stack... fire it off with CLI or API or console
			* Create Stack is the button you want to get to in the console
			* Delete Stack is another nice thing... "did I really delete everything I needed to?" > Yes!
			* Configuration as code: Version control! 
		* docker: For environment configuration (to avoid go install all of these packages)
		* Jenkins: DevOps gap-filling glue. "Continuous integration (CI) tool"
			* check out a git repo
			* build a Java app
			* integrate with slack / email / ... 
			* Kilroy worth a look I think: We should understand what all Jenkins can do... "warr files"?
				* Could this be Brian Warr? Probably not.
