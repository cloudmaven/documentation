## Introduction

This page describes a consulting service available to researchers writing grant proposals at the 
University of Washington: Specifically for including the public cloud as a means to doing research 
computing.

## Warnings

- ***It is a 'new thing' to propose migrating your research to the public cloud. In our experience it is 
quite a welcome development at funding agencies; however some misconceptions still persist and we therefore
encourage proposal writers to check directly with the funding agency program manager before proceeding.***
