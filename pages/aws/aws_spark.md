## Warnings
- ***On the AWS cloud platform you have access to a cloud service that 
facilitates using Spark. This is called Elastic Map Reduce or EMR. AWS
also provides a data warehouse service called Redshift. You are not obliged
to use either of these to fully implement an Apache Spark data analysis 
framework on AWS. These technologies are optional; see for example Tim
Durham's genomics case study.***
