## Introduction


This page reviews the Microsoft Azure public cloud platform with some specifics on the Azure relationship 
to the University of Washington.


### What is Azure?

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services. It resides on a global network of datacenters as physical
hardware and installed software; where resources are available at specified 'per unit time' and often 
'per resource size' cost rates. The University of Washington use model for research uses a single 
mega-account that is broken into **subscriptions**. As a participant you would set up a purchase order,
receive subscription details, and begin using the Azure cloud typically through a browser interface.
At the end of each month you are billed so it is one of the *costs* of working in the cloud that you
learn how to manage and track your spending over time. Our objective here -- and on other introductory
pages on cloud computing -- is to help you evaluate the costs and benefits of learning the cloud.
