### Runbook and module galleries for Azure Automation
Rather than creating your own runbooks and modules in Azure Automation, you can access a variety of scenarios that have already been built by Microsoft and the community. You can either use these scenarios without modification or you can use them as a starting point and edit them for your specific requirements.

You can get runbooks from the [Runbook Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-runbook-gallery#runbooks-in-runbook-gallery) and modules from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-runbook-gallery#modules-in-powerShell-gallery). You can also contribute to the community by sharing scenarios that you develop.

### Overview of Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) model for managing your Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview), or you can install it on your local machine and use it in any PowerShell session.
