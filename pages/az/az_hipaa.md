## HIPAA/HITECH Implementation Guidance


HIPAA and the HITECH Act are United States laws that apply to most doctors' offices, hospitals, health 
insurance companies, and other companies involved in the healthcare industry that may have access to 
patient information (called Protected Health Information, or PHI). In many circumstances, for a covered 
healthcare company to use a service such as Microsoft Azure, the service provider must agree in a 
written agreement to adhere to certain security and privacy provisions set out in HIPAA and the HITECH Act. 


This guide was developed to assist customers interested in HIPAA and the HITECH Act to understand the 
relevant capabilities of Microsoft Azure. The intended audience for this guide includes privacy officers, 
security officers, compliance officers, and others in customer organizations responsible for HIPAA and 
HITECH Act implementation and compliance. 


While Microsoft Azure includes features to help enable customer's privacy and security compliance, 
customers are responsible for ensuring their particular use of Azure complies with HIPAA, the HITECH 
Act, and other applicable laws and regulations.


The scope of HIPAA was extended with the enactment of the Health Information Technology for 
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. Together, HIPAA and HITECH Act rules include:
 

- The HIPAA Privacy Rule, which focuses on the right of individuals to control the use of their personal information, and covers the confidentiality of PHI, limiting its use and disclosure.
- The HIPAA Security Rule, which sets the standards for administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect electronic PHI from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. It also includes such organizational requirements as Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).
- The HITECH Breach Notification Final Rule, which requires giving notice to individuals and the government when a breach of unsecured PHI occurs.


HIPAA regulations require that covered entities and their business associates in this case, Microsoft when 
it provides services, including cloud services, to covered entities enter into contracts to ensure that 
those business associates will adequately protect PHI. These contracts, or BAAs, clarify and limit how 
the business associate can handle PHI, and set forth each party's adherence to the security and privacy 
provisions set forth in HIPAA and the HITECH Act. Once a BAA is in place, Microsoft customers' covered 
entities can use its services to process and store PHI. 


Microsoft enterprise cloud services are also covered by FedRAMP assessments. Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 
Azure Government received a Provisional Authority to Operate from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board; 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 U.S. Government received an Agency Authority to Operate from the US Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, as did Microsoft Office 365 U.S. Government from the US Department of Health 
and Human Services.
