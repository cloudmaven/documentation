## Objective
This hands-on course will introduce participants to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Compute power, 
storage, network connectivity, and data management tools. It will also introduce some of the powerful 
features of GCP that can facilitate data science and will back these up with cloud adoption success 
stories. 


The course will include an overview of cloud computing terminology, 
how cloud computing environments are made secure, cost estimation and tracking, 
and how massive available resources on the cloud reduce processing time. To make
the course as hands-on as possible we will have participants start their own accounts 
to try things out using an initial modest credit grant.


Our two main requests from attendees are 'Explain how I get compute instances up and 
running' and 'explain how I get to doing machine learning on the cloud.' The UW Research 
Computing group is working with the Google course presenters to address these topics
specifically. Our goal is for participants to be able to leave the class with plenty of 
momentum to carry further; and both ourselves and Google employees are available 
through office hours at the Data Science Studio to help with follow on questions.
