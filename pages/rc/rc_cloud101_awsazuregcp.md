## Objective
This three-day, hands-on immersion course will introduce participants to  three major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform).

The UW-IT Research Computing team and the eScience Institute will host
three half-day Cloud101 sessions on November 13, 14 and 15, 2017 for
AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform respectively.

Each day (9am - 12pm) will focus on the basics of cloud computing on
the public cloud:

Nov. 13 - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Nov. 14 - Microsoft Azure
Nov. 15 - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

We will focus on cloud computing terminology, creating a secure
environment for your work, costing the cloud in advance, and  granular
cost management as you go. We will demonstrate the basic process of
starting and configuring both virtual machines and cloud storage and
will overview other key mechanisms that help you translate your
computing
to the public cloud. We will also share a number of early-adopter
success stories.

Participants can choose to any or all of the days, but please be
considerate and attend the workshops you register for.
