## Introduction


This page describes a research data management technology called [Globus](http://globus.org) originating 
from the [Globus Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_Alliance) out of UChicago and Argonne
National Laboratory. The Globus Alliance began in 1997 under the mission framework of grid computing:
Affiliating compute resources to facilitate cost-effective data management. The Globus watchwords are
**Transfer**, **Share** and **Publish**. Quoting wikipedia on grid computing, 'A grid is a 
persistent environment that enables software applications to integrate instruments, displays,
computational, and information resources that are managed by diverse organizations in widespread
locations.


An ad hoc criticism of grid computing would point out that a loosely coupled system exchanges 
organization for resources. That is: It is possible to take advantage of built 
cyberinfrastructure--unused resources--at a savings in cost; but software is complicated 
and the management framework should solve inter-system compatibility issues... or require
extensive effort from the developers. This sets aside questions of data security; another
obvious concern.
